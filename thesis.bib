  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to
	many important problems in life science. For example the sequencing
	of the human genome 1 would not have been possible without advanced
	assembly algorithms. However, owing to the high speed of technological
	progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there is a
	widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and
	the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread
	use. RESULTS: To remedy this trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a
	library of efficient data types and algorithms for sequence analysis
	in computational biology. SeqAn comprises implementations of existing,
	practical state-of-the-art algorithmic components to provide a sound
	basis for algorithm testing and development. In this paper we describe
	the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving
	two examples. In the first example we show an application of SeqAn
	as an experimental platform by comparing different exact string matching
	algorithms. The second example is a simple version of the well-known
	MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results indicate that our implementation
	is very efficient and versatile to use. CONCLUSION: We anticipate
	that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new bioinformatics
	tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-designed
	algorithmic components which are fundamental for the field of sequence
	analysis. This leverages not only the implementation of new algorithms,
	but also enables a sound analysis and comparison of existing algorithms},

	a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment
	(BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence
	database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory.

  abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new
	DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and
	accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based
	methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature
	rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual.
	However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads,
	which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels
	may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the
	alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results:
	We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment
	package that is based on backward search with Burrows√êWheeler Transform
	(BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large
	reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches
	and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina
	sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines.
	Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is 10--20
	faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA

	can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:

	abstract ={Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled the rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost. A crucial first step in many sequencing applications is to map those reads to a reference genome. However, when the reference genome is large, finding accurate mappings poses a significant computational challenge due to the sheer amount of reads, and because many reads map to the reference sequence approximately but not exactly. We introduce Hobbes, a new gram-based program for aligning short reads, supporting Hamming and edit distance. Hobbes implements two novel techniques, which yield substantial performance improvements: an optimized gram-selection procedure for reads, and a cache-efficient filter for pruning candidate mappings. We systematically tested the performance of Hobbes on both real and simulated data with read lengths varying from 35 to 100?bp, and compared its performance with several state-of-the-art read-mapping programs, including Bowtie, BWA, mrsFast and RazerS. Hobbes is faster than all other read mapping programs we have tested while maintaining high mapping quality. Hobbes is about five times faster than Bowtie and about 2–10 times faster than BWA, depending on read length and error rate, when asked to find all mapping locations of a read in the human genome within a given Hamming or edit distance, respectively. Hobbes supports the SAM output format and is publicly available at http://hobbes.ics.uci.edu.},

note = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bts505}, 
abstract ={Motivation: During the last years NGS sequencing has become a key technology for many applications in the biomedical sciences. Throughput continues to increase and new protocols provide longer reads than currently available. In almost all applications, read mapping is a first step. Hence, it is crucial to have algorithms and implementations that perform fast, with high sensitivity, and are able to deal with long reads and a large absolute number of indels. Results: RazerS is a read mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on counting q-grams. In this work we propose the successor RazerS 3 which now supports shared-memory parallelism, an additional seed-based filter with adjustable sensitivity, a much faster, banded version of the Myers’ bit-vector algorithm for verification, memory saving measures and support for the SAM output format. This leads to a much improved performance for mapping reads, in particular long reads with many errors. We extensively compare RazerS 3 with other popular read mappers and show that its results are often superior to them in terms of sensitivity while exhibiting practical and often competetive run times. In addition, RazerS 3 works without a precomputed index. Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/razers. RazerS 3 is implemented in C++ and OpenMP under a GPL license using the SeqAn library and supports Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.Contact: david.weese@fu-berlin.de},

To accomplish this task, numerous software tools have been proposed. Determining the mappers that are most suitable for a specific application is not trivial.Results: This survey focuses on classifying mappers through a wide number of characteristics. The goal is to allow practitioners to compare the mappers more easily and find those that are most suitable for their specific problem.Availability: A regularly updated compendium of mappers can be found at http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/fg/hts_mappers/.Contact: nf@ebi.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
