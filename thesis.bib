	Abstract = {Despite their importance in gene innovation and phenotypic variation, duplicated regions have remained largely intractable owing to difficulties in accurately resolving their structure, copy number and sequence content. We present an algorithm (mrFAST) to comprehensively map next-generation sequence reads, which allows for the prediction of absolute copy-number variation of duplicated segments and genes. We examine three human genomes and experimentally validate genome-wide copy number differences. We estimate that, on average, 73-87 genes vary in copy number between any two individuals and find that these genic differences overwhelmingly correspond to segmental duplications (odds ratio = 135; P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Our method can distinguish between different copies of highly identical genes, providing a more accurate assessment of gene content and insight into functional constraint without the limitations of array-based technology.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

	Abstract = {Statistical modeling of sequences is a central paradigm of machine learning that finds multiple uses in computational molecular biology and many other domains. The probabilistic automata typically built in these contexts are subtended by uniform, fixed-memory Markov models. In practice, such automata tend to be unnecessarily bulky and computationally imposing both during their synthesis and use. Recently, D. Ron, Y. Singer, and N. Tishby built much more compact, tree-shaped variants of probabilistic automata under the assumption of an underlying Markov process of variable memory length. These variants, called Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs) were subsequently adapted by G. Bejerano and G. Yona and applied successfully to learning and prediction of protein families. The process of learning the automaton from a given training set S of sequences requires theta(Ln2) worst-case time, where n is the total length of the sequences in S and L is the length of a longest substring of S to be considered for a candidate state in the automaton. Once the automaton is built, predicting the likelihood of a query sequence of m characters may cost time theta(m2) in the worst case. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce automata equivalent to PSTs but having the following properties: Learning the automaton, for any L, takes O (n) time. Prediction of a string of m symbols by the automaton takes O (m) time. Along the way, the paper presents an evolving learning scheme and addresses notions of empirical probability and related efficient computation, which is a by-product possibly of more general interest.},

	Abstract = {To provide the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information, the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities have united to form the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt) consortium. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss-Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross-references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non-redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). The scientific community is encouraged to submit data for inclusion in UniProt.},

@article{Backofen2004,
	Abstract = {Ribonuclic acid (RNA) enjoys increasing interest in molecular biology; despite this interest fundamental algorithms are lacking, e.g. for identifying local motifs. As proteins, RNA molecules have a distinctive structure. Therefore, in addition to sequence information, structure plays an important part in assessing the similarity of RNAs. Furthermore, common sequence-structure features in two or several RNA molecules are often only spatially local, where possibly large parts of the molecules are dissimilar. Consequently, we address the problem of comparing RNA molecules by computing an optimal local alignment with respect to sequence and structure information. While local alignment is superior to global alignment for identifying local similarities, no general local sequence-structure alignment algorithms are currently known. We suggest a new general definition of locality for sequence-structure alignments that is biologically motivated and efficiently tractable. To show the former, we discuss locality of RNA and prove that the defined locality means connectivity by atomic and non-atomic bonds. To show the latter, we present an efficient algorithm for the newly defined pairwise local sequence-structure alignment (lssa) problem for RNA. For molecules of lengthes n and m, the algorithm has worst-case time complexity of O(n2 x m2 x max(n,m)) and a space complexity of only O(n x m). An implementation of our algorithm is available at http://www.bio.inf.uni-jena.de. Its runtime is competitive with global sequence-structure alignment.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Characterization of a protein family by its distinct sequence domains is crucial for functional annotation and correct classification of newly discovered proteins. Conventional Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) based methods find difficulties when faced with heterogeneous groups of proteins. However, even many families of proteins that do share a common domain contain instances of several other domains, without any common underlying linear ordering. Ignoring this modularity may lead to poor or even false classification results. An automated method that can analyze a group of proteins into the sequence domains it contains is therefore highly desirable. RESULTS: We apply a novel method to the problem of protein domain detection. The method takes as input an unaligned group of protein sequences. It segments them and clusters the segments into groups sharing the same underlying statistics. A Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model is built using a Prediction Suffix Tree (PST) data structure for each group of segments. Refinement is achieved by letting the PSTs compete over the segments, and a deterministic annealing framework infers the number of underlying PST models while avoiding many inferior solutions. We show that regions of similar statistics correlate well with protein sequence domains, by matching a unique signature to each domain. This is done in a fully automated manner, and does not require or attempt an MSA. Several representative cases are analyzed. We identify a protein fusion event, refine an HMM superfamily classification into the underlying families the HMM cannot separate, and detect all 12 instances of a short domain in a group of 396 sequences.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: We present a method for modeling protein families by means of probabilistic suffix trees (PSTs). The method is based on identifying significant patterns in a set of related protein sequences. The patterns can be of arbitrary length, and the input sequences do not need to be aligned, nor is delineation of domain boundaries required. The method is automatic, and can be applied, without assuming any preliminary biological information, with surprising success. Basic biological considerations such as amino acid background probabilities, and amino acids substitution probabilities can be incorporated to improve performance. RESULTS: The PST can serve as a predictive tool for protein sequence classification, and for detecting conserved patterns (possibly functionally or structurally important) within protein sequences. The method was tested on the Pfam database of protein families with more than satisfactory performance. Exhaustive evaluations show that the PST model detects much more related sequences than pairwise methods such as Gapped-BLAST, and is almost as sensitive as a hidden Markov model that is trained from a multiple alignment of the input sequences, while being much faster.},

@article{Ben-Gal2005,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: We propose a new class of variable-order Bayesian network (VOBN) models for the identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). The proposed models generalize the widely used position weight matrix (PWM) models, Markov models and Bayesian network models. In contrast to these models, where for each position a fixed subset of the remaining positions is used to model dependencies, in VOBN models, these subsets may vary based on the specific nucleotides observed, which are called the context. This flexibility turns out to be of advantage for the classification and analysis of TFBSs, as statistical dependencies between nucleotides in different TFBS positions (not necessarily adjacent) may be taken into account efficiently--in a position-specific and context-specific manner. RESULTS: We apply the VOBN model to a set of 238 experimentally verified sigma-70 binding sites in Escherichia coli. We find that the VOBN model can distinguish these 238 sites from a set of 472 intergenic 'non-promoter' sequences with a higher accuracy than fixed-order Markov models or Bayesian trees. We use a replicated stratified-holdout experiment having a fixed true-negative rate of 99.9\%. We find that for a foreground inhomogeneous VOBN model of order 1 and a background homogeneous variable-order Markov (VOM) model of order 5, the obtained mean true-positive (TP) rate is 47.56\%. In comparison, the best TP rate for the conventional models is 44.39\%, obtained from a foreground PWM model and a background 2nd-order Markov model. As the standard deviation of the estimated TP rate is approximately 0.01\%, this improvement is highly significant.},

	Abstract = {Revolutionary new technologies, capable of transforming the economics of sequencing, are providing an unparalleled opportunity to analyze human genetic variation comprehensively at the whole-genome level within a realistic timeframe and at affordable costs. Current estimates suggest that it would cost somewhere in the region of 30 million US dollars to sequence an entire human genome using Sanger-based sequencing, and on one machine it would take about 60 years. Solexa is widely regarded as a company with the necessary disruptive technology to be the first to achieve the ultimate goal of the so-called 1,000 dollars human genome -- the conceptual cost-point needed for routine analysis of individual genomes. Solexa's technology is based on completely novel sequencing chemistry capable of sequencing billions of individual DNA molecules simultaneously, a base at a time, to enable highly accurate, low cost analysis of an entire human genome in a single experiment. When applied over a large enough genomic region, these new approaches to resequencing will enable the simultaneous detection and typing of known, as well as unknown, polymorphisms, and will also offer information about patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the population being studied. Technological progress, leading to the advent of single-molecule-based approaches, is beginning to dramatically drive down costs and increase throughput to unprecedented levels, each being several orders of magnitude better than that which is currently available. A new sequencing paradigm based on single molecules will be faster, cheaper and more sensitive, and will permit routine analysis at the whole-genome level.},

	Abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

Several such test sets now exist, each with potential strengths and weaknesses. We apply several different alignment packages to 6 benchmark datasets, and compare their relative performances. HOMSTRAD, a collection of alignments of homologous proteins, is regularly used as a benchmark for sequence alignment though it is not designed as such, and lacks annotation of reliable regions within the alignment. We introduce this annotation into HOMSTRAD using protein structural superposition. Results on each database show that method performance is dependent on the input sequences. Alignment benchmarks are regularly used in combination to measure performance across a spectrum of alignment problems. Through combining benchmarks, it is possible to detect whether a program has been over-optimised for a single dataset, or alignment problem type.},

@article{Brazma1998,
	Abstract = {We performed a systematic analysis of gene upstream regions in the yeast genome for occurrences of regular expression-type patterns with the goal of identifying potential regulatory elements. To achieve this goal, we have developed a new sequence pattern discovery algorithm that searches exhaustively for a priori unknown regular expression-type patterns that are over-represented in a given set of sequences. We applied the algorithm in two cases, (1) discovery of patterns in the complete set of >6000 sequences taken upstream of the putative yeast genes and (2) discovery of patterns in the regions upstream of the genes with similar expression profiles. In the first case, we looked for patterns that occur more frequently in the gene upstream regions than in the genome overall. In the second case, first we clustered the upstream regions of all the genes by similarity of their expression profiles on the basis of publicly available gene expression data and then looked for sequence patterns that are over-represented in each cluster. In both cases we considered each pattern that occurred at least in some minimum number of sequences, and rated them on the basis of their over-representation. Among the highest rating patterns, most have matches to substrings in known yeast transcription factor-binding sites. Moreover, several of them are known to be relevant to the expression of the genes from the respective clusters. Experiments on simulated data show that the majority of the discovered patterns are not expected to occur by chance.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: The amount of genomic sequence data being generated and made available through public databases continues to increase at an ever-expanding rate. Downloading, copying, sharing and manipulating these large datasets are becoming difficult and time consuming for researchers. We need to consider using advanced compression techniques as part of a standard data format for genomic data. The inherent structure of genome data allows for more efficient lossless compression than can be obtained through the use of generic compression programs. We apply a series of techniques to James Watson's genome that in combination reduce it to a mere 4MB, small enough to be sent as an email attachment.},

@article{Doering2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to many important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the human genome 1 would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms. However, owing to the high speed of technological progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there is a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use. RESULTS: To remedy this trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types and algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn comprises implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art algorithmic components to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing and development. In this paper we describe the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving two examples. In the first example we show an application of SeqAn as an experimental platform by comparing different exact string matching algorithms. The second example is a simple version of the well-known MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results indicate that our implementation is very efficient and versatile to use. CONCLUSION: We anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new bioinformatics tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-designed algorithmic components which are fundamental for the field of sequence analysis. This leverages not only the implementation of new algorithms, but also enables a sound analysis and comparison of existing algorithms},

@article{Dalevi2006,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Analyses of genomic signatures are gaining attention as they allow studies of species-specific relationships without involving alignments of homologous sequences. A na?ve Bayesian classifier was built to discriminate between different bacterial compositions of short oligomers, also known as DNA words. The classifier has proven successful in identifying foreign genes in Neisseria meningitis. In this study we extend the classifier approach using either a fixed higher order Markov model (Mk) or a variable length Markov model (VLMk). RESULTS: We propose a simple algorithm to lock a variable length Markov model to a certain number of parameters and show that the use of Markov models greatly increases the flexibility and accuracy in prediction to that of a na?ve model. We also test the integrity of classifiers in terms of false-negatives and give estimates of the minimal sizes of training data. We end the report by proposing a method to reject a false hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer.

@article{Dohm2008,
	Abstract = {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning of reads to 3.8% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.},

@article{Dressman2003,
	Abstract = {Many areas of biomedical research depend on the analysis of uncommon
 variations in individual genes or transcripts. Here we describe a method that
 can quantify such variation at a scale and ease heretofore unattainable. Each
 DNA molecule in a collection of such molecules is converted into a single
 magnetic particle to which thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to
 the original are bound. This population of beads then corresponds to a
 one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules. Variation within the
 original population of DNA molecules can then be simply assessed by counting
 fluorescently labeled particles via flow cytometry. This approach is called
 BEAMing on the basis of four of its principal components (beads, emulsion,
 amplification, and magnetics). Millions of individual DNA molecules can be
 assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment. Moreover,
 specific variants can be isolated by flow sorting and used for further
 experimentation. BEAMing can be used for the identification and quantification
 of rare mutations as well as to study variations in gene sequences or
 transcripts in specific populations or tissues.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The reliable detection of genomic variation in resequencing data is still a major challenge, especially for variants larger than a few base pairs. Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the potential for their identification, but are difficult to map.Results: Here we present a method for `split' read mapping, where prefix and suffix match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment. We use this method to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared with alternative split mapping methods, SplazerS significantly improves sensitivity for detecting large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our method is robust in the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic mutations/divergence, and can be used on reads of variable lengths. Our analysis shows that SplazerS is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored or single-end as well as anchored paired-end reads. In addition, application of SplazerS to targeted resequencing data led to the interesting discovery of a complete, possibly functional gene retrocopy variant.Availability: SplazerS is available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/ splazers.Contact: emde@inf.fu-berlin.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

One parameter for duplex initiation and 10 parameters for helix propagation are derived from enthalpy and free-energy changes for helix formation by 45 RNA oligonucleotide duplexes. The oligomer sequences were chosen to maximize reliability of secondary structure predictions. Each of the 10 nearest-neighbor sequences is well-represented among the 45 oligonucleotides, and the sequences were chosen to minimize experimental errors in delta GO at 37 degrees C. These parameters predict melting temperatures of most oligonucleotide duplexes within 5 degrees C. This is about as good as can be expected from the nearest-neighbor model. Free-energy changes for helix propagation at dangling ends, terminal mismatches, and internal G X U mismatches, and free-energy changes for helix initiation at hairpin loops, internal loops, or internal bulges are also tabulated.},

Until now, the Sanger sequencing technology that has served as a platform for WGS has not been truly challenged by emerging technologies. The recent introduction of the pyrosequencing-based 454 sequencing platform (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) offers a very promising sequencing technology alternative for incorporation in WGS. In this study, we evaluated the utility and cost-effectiveness of a hybrid sequencing approach using 3730xl Sanger data and 454 data to generate higher-quality lower-cost assemblies of microbial genomes compared to current Sanger sequencing strategies alone.},

The RNA acts as a true catalyst under these conditions whereas the protein moieties of the enzymes alone show no catalytic activity. However, in buffers containing 5-10 mM Mg2+ (in the absence of spermidine) both kinds of subunits are required for enzymatic activity, as shown previously. In the presence of low concentrations of Mg2+, in vitro, the RNA and protein subunits from one species can complement subunits from the other species in reconstitution experiments. When the precursor to E. coli 4.5S RNA is used as a substrate, only the enzyme complexes formed with M1 RNA from E. coli and the protein moieties from either bacterial species are active.},

@article{Hall2007,
	Abstract = {In the past 10 years, microbiology has undergone a revolution that has been driven by access to cheap high-throughput DNA sequencing. It was not long ago that the cloning and sequencing of a target gene could take months or years, whereas now this entire process has been replaced by a 10 min Internet search of a public genome database. There has been no single innovation that has initiated this rapid technological change; in fact, the core chemistry of DNA sequencing is the same as it was 30 years ago. Instead, progress has been driven by large sequencing centers that have incrementally industrialized the Sanger sequencing method. A side effect of this industrialization is that large-scale sequencing has moved out of small research labs, and the vast majority of sequence data is now generated by large genome centers. Recently, there have been advances in technology that will enable high-throughput genome sequencing to be established in research labs using bench-top instrumentation. These new technologies are already being used to explore the vast microbial diversity in the natural environment and the untapped genetic variation that can occur in bacterial species. It is expected that these powerful new methods will open up new questions to genomic investigation and will also allow high-throughput sequencing to be more than just a discovery exercise but also a routine assay for hypothesis testing. While this review will concentrate on microorganisms, many of the important arguments about the need to measure and understand variation at the species, population and ecosystem level will hold true for many other biological systems.},

	Abstract = {One of the key characteristics of stem cells is their capacity to divide for long periods of time in an environment where most of the cells are quiescent. Therefore, a critical question in stem cell biology is how stem cells escape cell division stop signals. Here, we report the necessity of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway for proper control of germline stem cell (GSC) division in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of GSCs mutant for dicer-1 (dcr-1), the double-stranded RNaseIII essential for miRNA biogenesis, revealed a marked reduction in the rate of germline cyst production. These dcr-1 mutant GSCs exhibit normal identity but are defective in cell cycle control. On the basis of cell cycle markers and genetic interactions, we conclude that dcr-1 mutant GSCs are delayed in the G1 to S transition, which is dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo, suggesting that miRNAs are required for stem cells to bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint. Hence, the miRNA pathway might be part of a mechanism that makes stem cells insensitive to environmental signals that normally stop the cell cycle at the G1/S transition.},

@article{Hoffmann2009a,
	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>The successful mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to reference genomes largely depends on the accuracy of both the sequencing technologies and reference genomes. Current mapping algorithms focus on mapping with mismatches but largely neglect insertions and deletions, regardless of whether they are caused by sequencing errors or genomic variation. Furthermore, trailing contaminations by primers and declining read qualities can be cumbersome for programs that allow a maximum number of mismatches. We have developed and implemented a new approach for short read mapping that, in a first step, computes exact matches of the read and the reference genome. The exact matches are then modified by a limited number of mismatches, insertions and deletions. From the set of exact and inexact matches, we select those with minimum score-based E-values. This gives a set of regions in the reference genome which is aligned to the read using Myers bitvector algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000502-Myers1">[1]</xref>. Our method utilizes enhanced suffix arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000502-Abouelhoda1">[2]</xref> to quickly find the exact and inexact matches. It maps more reads and achieves higher recall rates than previous methods. This consistently holds for reads produced by 454 as well as Illumina sequencing technologies.</p>},

@article{Holtgrewe2011,
	Abstract = {Second generation sequencing technologies yield DNA sequence data at ultra high-throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. The assessment of the quality of read mapping results is not straightforward and has not been formalized so far. Hence, it has not been easy to compare different read mapping approaches in a unified way and to determine which program is the best for what task.We present a new benchmark method, called Rabema (Read Alignment BEnchMArk), for read mappers. It consists of a strict definition of the read mapping problem and of tools to evaluate the result of arbitrary read mappers supporting the SAM output format.We show the usefulness of the benchmark program by performing a comparison of popular read mappers. The tools supporting the benchmark are licensed under the GPL and available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/rabema.html.},

@article{Karlin1990,
	Abstract = {An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.},

Practical local aligners are in general fast, but heuristic, and hence sometimes miss significant matches.RESULTS:We present here the local pairwise aligner STELLAR that has full sensitivity for epsilon-alignments, i.e. guarantees to report all local alignments of a given minimal length and maximal error rate. The aligner is composed of two steps, filtering and verification. We apply the SWIFT algorithm for lossless filtering, and have developed a new verification strategy that we prove to be exact. Our results on simulated and real genomic data confirm and quantify the conjecture that heuristic tools like BLAST or BLAT miss a large percentage of significant local alignments.CONCLUSIONS:STELLAR is very practical and fast on very long sequences which makes it a suitable new tool for finding local alignments between genomic sequences under the edit distance model.

	Abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural RNA genes exhibit unique evolutionary patterns that are designed to conserve their secondary structures; these patterns should be taken into account while constructing accurate multiple alignments of RNA genes. The Sankoff algorithm is a natural alignment algorithm that includes the effect of base-pair covariation in the alignment model. However, the extremely high computational cost of the Sankoff algorithm precludes its application to most RNA sequences. RESULTS: We propose an efficient algorithm for the multiple alignment of structural RNA sequences. Our algorithm is a variant of the Sankoff algorithm, and it uses an efficient scoring system that reduces the time and space requirements considerably without compromising on the alignment quality. First, our algorithm computes the match probability matrix that measures the alignability of each position pair between sequences as well as the base pairing probability matrix for each sequence. These probabilities are then combined to score the alignment using the Sankoff algorithm. By itself, our algorithm does not predict the consensus secondary structure of the alignment but uses external programs for the prediction. We demonstrate that both the alignment quality and the accuracy of the consensus secondary structure prediction from our alignment are the highest among the other programs examined. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can align relatively long RNA sequences such as the eukaryotic-type signal recognition particle RNA that is approximately 300 nt in length; multiple alignment of such sequences has not been possible by using other Sankoff-based algorithms. The algorithm is implemented in the software named 'Murlet'. AVAILABILITY: The C++ source code of the Murlet software and the test dataset used in this study are available at http://www.ncrna.org/papers/Murlet/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

No programs have yet been published that allow searching a sequence database for homologs of a single RNA molecule on the basis of secondary structure.RESULTS:We have developed a program, RSEARCH, that takes a single RNA sequence with its secondary structure and utilizes a local alignment algorithm to search a database for homologous RNAs. For this purpose, we have developed a series of base pair and single nucleotide substitution matrices for RNA sequences called RIBOSUM matrices. RSEARCH reports the statistical confidence for each hit as well as the structural alignment of the hit. We show several examples in which RSEARCH outperforms the primary sequence search programs BLAST and SSEARCH. The primary drawback of the program is that it is slow. The C code for RSEARCH is freely available from our lab's website.CONCLUSION:RSEARCH outperforms primary sequence programs in finding homologs of structured RNA sequences.},

By representing images in symbolic manner, according to their color and texture characteristics, we enable mining of JESs in sets of visual data and use mined patterns to create efficient and accurate classifiers. In this paper we describe our approach to image representation and provide experimental results of JES-based classification of well-known image datasets. },

The SRA was established as a public repository for next-generation sequence data as a part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC is composed of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra from NCBI, at www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp from DDBJ.

	Abstract = {To explore the role of Dicer-dependent control mechanisms in B lymphocyte development, we ablated this enzyme in early B cell progenitors. This resulted in a developmental block at the pro- to pre-B cell transition. Gene-expression profiling revealed a miR-17 approximately 92 signature in the 3'UTRs of genes upregulated in Dicer-deficient pro-B cells; a top miR-17 approximately 92 target, the proapoptotic molecule Bim, was highly upregulated. Accordingly, B cell development could be partially rescued by ablation of Bim or transgenic expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. This allowed us to assess the impact of Dicer deficiency on the V(D)J recombination program in developing B cells. We found intact Ig gene rearrangements in immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and kappa chain loci, but increased sterile transcription and usage of D(H) elements of the DSP family in IgH, and increased N sequence addition in Igkappa due to deregulated transcription of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene.},

	Abstract = {lin-4 is essential for the normal temporal control of diverse postembryonic developmental events in C. elegans. lin-4 acts by negatively regulating the level of LIN-14 protein, creating a temporal decrease in LIN-14 protein starting in the first larval stage (L1). We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

Variable length Markov chains (VLMC) are a promising class of models that can effectively classify proteins into families and they can be estimated in linear time and space. RESULTS: We introduce a new algorithm, called Sparse Probabilistic Suffix Trees (SPST), that identifies equivalence between the contexts of a VLMC. We show that, in many cases, the identification of these equivalence can improve the classification rate of the classical Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PST) algorithm. We also show that better classification can be achieved by identifying representative fingerprints in the amino acid chains, and this variation in the SPST algorithm is called F-SPST.},

@article{Li2010a,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads >200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both.Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.netContact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with BurrowsÐWheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is 10--20 faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability: http://maq.sourceforge.netContact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {Summary: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.Availability: http://samtools.sourceforge.netContact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {Rapidly evolving sequencing technologies produce data on an unparalleled scale. A central challenge to the analysis of this data is sequence alignment, whereby sequence reads must be compared to a reference. A wide variety of alignment algorithms and software have been subsequently developed over the past two years. In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no longer the bottleneck of data analyses. We also consider future development of alignment algorithms with respect to emerging long sequence reads and the prospect of cloud computing.},

We used a Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT) compression index to substitute the seed strategy for indexing the reference sequence in the main memory. We tested it on the whole human genome and found that this new algorithm reduced memory usage from 14.7 to 5.4 GB and improved alignment speed by 20--30 times. SOAP2 is compatible with both single- and paired-end reads. Additionally, this tool now supports multiple text and compressed file formats.

Here we use a new, bead-based flow cytometric miRNA expression profiling method to present a systematic expression analysis of 217 mammalian miRNAs from 334 samples, including multiple human cancers. The miRNA profiles are surprisingly informative, reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumours. We observe a general downregulation of miRNAs in tumours compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, we were able to successfully classify poorly differentiated tumours using miRNA expression profiles, whereas messenger RNA profiles were highly inaccurate when applied to the same samples. These findings highlight the potential of miRNA profiling in cancer diagnosis.},

	Abstract = {A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences with <6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84\% of known canonical base pairs.},

	Abstract = {An improved dynamic programming algorithm is reported for RNA secondary structure prediction by free energy minimization. Thermodynamic parameters for the stabilities of secondary structure motifs are revised to include expanded sequence dependence as revealed by recent experiments. Additional algorithmic improvements include reduced search time and storage for multibranch loop free energies and improved imposition of folding constraints. An extended database of 151,503 nt in 955 structures? determined by comparative sequence analysis was assembled to allow optimization of parameters not based on experiments and to test the accuracy of the algorithm. On average, the predicted lowest free energy structure contains 73 \% of known base-pairs when domains of fewer than 700 nt are folded; this compares with 64 \% accuracy for previous versions of the algorithm and parameters. For a given sequence, a set of 750 generated structures contains one structure that, on average, has 86 \% of known base-pairs. Experimental constraints, derived from enzymatic and flavin mononucleotide cleavage, improve the accuracy of structure predictions},

Its generality arises from the ability to handle sequences described with any alphabet (nucleotides, amino acids, codons and others). seq++ enables sequence modelling with various types of Markov models, including variable length Markov models and the newly developed parsimonious Markov models, all of them potentially phased. Simulation modules are supplied for Monte Carlo methods. Hence, this toolbox allows the study of any biological process which can be described by a series of states taken from a finite set.},

	Abstract = {We identified the sequence-specific starting positions of consecutive miscalls in the mapping of reads obtained from the Illumina Genome Analyser (GA). Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error (SSE) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) GGC sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded DNA and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Moreover, SSE is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly. This article highlights the importance of recognizing SSE and its underlying mechanisms in the hope of enhancing the potential usefulness of the Illumina sequencers.},

	Abstract = {We describe an algorithm, SSAHA (SequenceSearch and Alignment by HashingAlgorithm), for performing fast searches on databases containing multiple gigabases of DNA. Sequences in the database are preprocessed by breaking them into consecutive k-tuples ofk contiguous bases and then using a hash table to store the position of each occurrence of each k-tuple. Searching for a query sequence in the database is done by obtaining from the hash table the ?hits? for each k-tuple in the query sequence and then performing a sort on the results. We discuss the effect of the tuple length k on the search speed, memory usage, and sensitivity of the algorithm and present the results of computational experiments which show that SSAHA can be three to four orders of magnitude faster than BLAST or FASTA, while requiring less memory than suffix tree methods. The SSAHAalgorithm is used for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection and very large scale sequence assembly. Also, it provides Web-based sequence search facilities for Ensembl projects.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-23 nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have diverse functions, including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a. These findings expand the known classes of transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative signal.},

	Abstract = {A new method based on probabilistic suffix trees (PSTs) is defined for pairwise comparison of distantly related protein sequences. The new definition is adopted in a discriminative framework for protein classification using pairwise sequence similarity scores in feature encoding. The framework uses support vector machines (SVMs) to separate structurally similar and dissimilar examples. The new discriminative system, which we call as SVM-PST, has been tested for SCOP family classification task, and compared with existing discriminative methods SVM-BLAST and SVM-Pairwise, which use BLAST similarity scores and dynamic-programming-based alignment scores, respectively. Results have shown that SVM-PST is more accurate than SVM-BLAST and competitive with SVM-Pairwise. In terms of computational efficiency, PST-based comparison is much better than dynamic-programming-based alignment. We also compared our results with the original family-based PST approach from which we were inspired. The present method provides a significantly better solution for protein classification in comparison with the family-based PST model.},

	Abstract = {We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of protein and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

As a result of exceptional sample preservation and the use of a recently developed emulsion polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing technique, 13 million base pairs (45.4\%) of the sequencing reads were identified as mammoth DNA. Sequence identity between our data and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) was 98.55\%, consistent with a paleontologically based divergence date of 5 to 6 million years. The sample includes a surprisingly small diversity of environmental DNAs. The high percentage of endogenous DNA recoverable from this single mammoth would allow for completion of its genome, unleashing the field of paleogenomics.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Novel high-throughput sequencing technologies pose new algorithmic challenges in handling massive amounts of short-read, high-coverage data. A robust and versatile consensus tool is of particular interest for such data since a sound multi-read alignment is a prerequisite for variation analyses, accurate genome assemblies and insert sequencing.Results: A multi-read alignment algorithm for de novo or reference-guided genome assembly is presented. The program identifies segments shared by multiple reads and then aligns these segments using a consistency-enhanced alignment graph. On real de novo sequencing data obtained from the newly established NCBI Short Read Archive, the program performs similarly in quality to other comparable programs. On more challenging simulated datasets for insert sequencing and variation analyses, our program outperforms the other tools.Availability: The consensus program can be downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/consensus.html. It can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with the Celera Assembler. Both application scenarios as well as the usage of the tool are described in the documentation.Contact: rausch@inf.fu-berlin.de},

	Abstract = {BACKj-GROUND: Motif discovery aims to detect short, highly conserved patterns in a collection of unaligned DNA or protein sequences. Discriminative motif finding algorithms aim to increase the sensitivity and selectivity of motif discovery by utilizing a second set of sequences, and searching only for patterns that can differentiate the two sets of sequences. Potential applications of discriminative motif discovery include discovering transcription factor binding site motifs in ChIP-chip data and finding protein motifs involved in thermal stability using sets of orthologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. RESULTS: We describe DEME, a discriminative motif discovery algorithm for use with protein and DNA sequences. Input to DEME is two sets of sequences; a "positive" set and a "negative" set. DEME represents motifs using a probabilistic model, and uses a novel combination of global and local search to find the motif that optimally discriminates between the two sets of sequences. DEME is unique among discriminative motif finders in that it uses an informative Bayesian prior on protein motif columns, allowing it to incorporate prior knowledge of residue characteristics. We also introduce four, synthetic, discriminative motif discovery problems that are designed for evaluating discriminative motif finders in various biologically motivated contexts. We test DEME using these synthetic problems and on two biological problems: finding yeast transcription factor binding motifs in ChIP-chip data, and finding motifs that discriminate between groups of thermophilic and mesophilic orthologous proteins. CONCLUSION: Using artificial data, we show that DEME is more effective than a non-discriminative approach when there are "decoy" motifs or when a variant of the motif is present in the "negative" sequences. With real data, we show that DEME is as good, but not better than non-discriminative algorithms at discovering yeast transcription factor binding motifs. We also show that DEME can find highly informative thermal-stability protein motifs. Binaries for the stand-alone program DEME is free for academic use and is available at http://bioinformatics.org.au/deme/},

	Abstract = {BACKj-GROUND: The general problem of RNA secondary structure prediction under the widely used thermodynamic model is known to be NP-complete when the structures considered include arbitrary pseudoknots. For restricted classes of pseudoknots, several polynomial time algorithms have been designed, where the O(n6)time and O(n4) space algorithm by Rivas and Eddy is currently the best available program. RESULTS: We introduce the class of canonical simple recursive pseudoknots and present an algorithm that requires O(n4) time and O(n2) space to predict the energetically optimal structure of an RNA sequence, possible containing such pseudoknots. Evaluation against a large collection of known pseudoknotted structures shows the adequacy of the canonization approach and our algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: RNA pseudoknots of medium size can now be predicted reliably as well as efficiently by the new algorithm.},

	Abstract = {RNA pseudoknots are an important structural feature of RNAs, but often neglected in computer predictions for reasons of efficiency. Here, we present the pknotsRG Web Server for single sequence RNA secondary structure prediction including pseudoknots. pknotsRG employs the newest Turner energy rules for finding the structure of minimal free energy. The algorithm has been improved in several ways recently. First, it has been reimplemented in the C programming language, resulting in a 60-fold increase in speed. Second, all suboptimal foldings up to a user-defined threshold can be enumerated. For large scale analysis, a fast sliding window mode is available. Further improvements of the Web Server are a new output visualization using the PseudoViewer Web Service or RNAmovies for a movie like animation of several suboptimal foldings. The tool is available as source code, binary executable, online tool or as Web Service. The latter alternative allows for an easy integration into bio-informatics pipelines. pknotsRG is available at the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg).},

	Abstract = {Alternative splicing, polyadenylation of pre-messenger RNA molecules and differential promoter usage can produce a variety of transcript isoforms whose respective expression levels are regulated in time and space, thus contributing specific biological functions. However, the repertoire of mammalian alternative transcripts and their regulation are still poorly understood. Second-generation sequencing is now opening unprecedented routes to address the analysis of entire transcriptomes. Here, we developed methods that allow the prediction and quantification of alternative isoforms derived solely from exon expression levels in RNA-Seq data. These are based on an explicit statistical model and enable the prediction of alternative isoforms within or between conditions using any known gene annotation, as well as the relative quantification of known transcript structures. Applying these methods to a human RNA-Seq dataset, we validated a significant fraction of the predictions by RT-PCR. Data further showed that these predictions correlated well with information originating from junction reads. A direct comparison with exon arrays indicated improved performances of RNA-Seq over microarrays in the prediction of skipped exons. Altogether, the set of methods presented here comprehensively addresses multiple aspects of alternative isoform analysis. The software is available as an open-source R-package called Solas at http://cmb.molgen.mpg.de/2ndGenerationSequencing/Solas/.},

	Abstract = {BACKj-GROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts that exert their function without ever producing proteins. Noncoding RNA gene sequences do not have strong statistical signals, unlike protein coding genes. A reliable general purpose computational genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural RNA genes. The key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions observed in a pairwise alignment of two homologous sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved structural RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We formalize this intuition using three probabilistic "pair-grammars": a pair stochastic context free grammar modeling alignments constrained by structural RNA evolution, a pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments constrained by coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. from a BLASTN comparison of two related genomes) we classify the alignment into the coding, RNA, or null class according to the posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We have implemented this approach as a program, QRNA, which we consider to be a prototype structural noncoding RNA genefinder. Tests suggest that this approach detects noncoding RNA genes with a fair degree of reliability.},

Transcriptional profiling using genomic microarrays and beads has enabled the discovery of numerous miRNAs that are differentially expressed in normal tissues vs tumors and associated with cancer development, diagnosis, and prognosis. miRNA signatures can be used to detect and classify cancer and predict the severity of disease, with certain profiles of miRNA expression linked to aggressive cancers with advanced disease present at diagnosis. miRNAs have also become targets of novel anticancer gene therapy with antisense molecules that can inhibit miRNA activity currently being tested for their efficacy in a strategy of reducing miRNA activity on reporter genes bearing miRNA-binding sites. In the future, sophisticated genomic and proteomic techniques combined with complex bioinformatics data analyses will be required to translate these recent basic science discoveries to clinically useful diagnostic tests.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing the way biologists acquire and analyze genomic data. NGS machines, such as Illumina/Solexa and AB SOLiD, are able to sequence genomes more cheaply by 200-fold than previous methods. One of the main application areas of NGS technologies is the discovery of genomic variation within a given species. The first step in discovering this variation is the mapping of reads sequenced from a donor individual to a known (?reference?) genome. Differences between the reference and the reads are indicative either of polymorphisms, or of sequencing errors. Since the introduction of NGS technologies, many methods have been devised for mapping reads to reference genomes. However, these algorithms often sacrifice sensitivity for fast running time. While they are successful at mapping reads from organisms that exhibit low polymorphism rates, they do not perform well at mapping reads from highly polymorphic organisms. We present a novel read mapping method, SHRiMP, that can handle much greater amounts of polymorphism. Using <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic> as our target organism, we demonstrate that our method discovers significantly more variation than other methods. Additionally, we develop color-space extensions to classical alignment algorithms, allowing us to map color-space, or ?dibase?, reads generated by AB SOLiD sequencers.</p>},

In a series of tests on Haemophilus influenzae , Helicobacter pylori and other complete microbial genomes, this system has proven to be very accurate at locating virtually all the genes in these sequences, outperforming previous methods. A conservative estimate based on experiments on H.pylori and H. influenzae is that the system finds >97\% of all genes. GLIMMER uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) as a framework for capturing dependencies between nearby nucleotides in a DNA sequence. An IMM-based method makes predictions based on a variable context; i.e., a variable-length oligomer in a DNA sequence. The context used by GLIMMER changes depending on the local composition of the sequence. As a result, GLIMMER is more flexible and more powerful than fixed-order Markov methods, which have previously been the primary content-based technique for finding genes in microbial DNA.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput sequencing has made the analysis of new model organisms more affordable. Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values.Results: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble RNA-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.Availability and implementation: Oases is freely available under the GPL license at www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/Contact: dzerbino@ucsc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

For investigating issues regarding genome evolution, a particularly sensitive method was needed to permit alignment of a large proportion of the neutrally evolving regions. We selected a program called BLASTZ, an independent implementation of the Gapped BLAST algorithm specifically designed for aligning two long genomic sequences. BLASTZ was subsequently modified, both to attain efficiency adequate for aligning entire mammalian genomes and to increase its sensitivity. This work describes BLASTZ, its modifications, the hardware environment on which we run it, and several empirical studies to validate its results.},

This result lends itself to finding similarities by computer between pairs of biological sequences, such as proteins and nucleic acids.},

@article{Soares2006,
	Abstract = {The central dogma of molecular biology inspired by classical work in prokaryotic organisms accounts for only part of the genetic agenda of complex eukaryotes. First, post-transcriptional events lead to the generation of multiple mRNAs, proteins and functions from a single primary transcript, revealing regulatory networks distinct in mechanism and biological function from those controlling RNA transcription. Second, a variety of populous families of small RNAs (small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, siRNAs and shRNAs) assemble on ribonucleoprotein complexes and regulate virtually all aspects of the gene expression pathway, with profound biological consequences. Third, high-throughput methods of genomic analysis reveal that RNAs other than non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) represent a major component of the transcriptome that may perform novel functions in gene regulation and beyond. Post-transcriptional regulation, small RNAs and ncRNAs provide an expanding picture of the transcriptome that enriches our views of what genes are, how they operate, evolve and are regulated.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKj-GROUND: Aligning multiple RNA sequences is essential for analyzing non-coding RNAs. Although many alignment methods for non-coding RNAs, including Sankoff's algorithm for strict structural alignments, have been proposed, they are either inaccurate or computationally too expensive. Faster methods with reasonable accuracies are required for genome-scale analyses. RESULTS: We propose a fast algorithm for multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences that is an extension of our pairwise structural alignment method (implemented in SCARNA). The accuracies of the implemented software, MXSCARNA, are at least as favorable as those of state-of-art algorithms that are computationally much more expensive in time and memory. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method for structural alignment of multiple RNA sequences is fast enough for large-scale analyses with accuracies at least comparable to those of existing algorithms.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The functions of non-coding RNAs are strongly related to their secondary structures, but it is known that a secondary structure prediction of a single sequence is not reliable. Therefore, we have to collect similar RNA sequences with a common secondary structure for the analyses of a new non-coding RNA without knowing the exact secondary structure itself. Therefore, the sequence comparison in searching similar RNAs should consider not only their sequence similarities but also their potential secondary structures. Sankoff's algorithm predicts the common secondary structures of the sequences, but it is computationally too expensive to apply to large-scale analyses. Because we often want to compare a large number of cDNA sequences or to search similar RNAs in the whole genome sequences, much faster algorithms are required. RESULTS: We propose a new method of comparing RNA sequences based on the structural alignments of the fixed-length fragments of the stem candidates. The implemented software, SCARNA (Stem Candidate Aligner for RNAs), is fast enough to apply to the long sequences in the large-scale analyses. The accuracy of the alignments is better or comparable with the much slower existing algorithms.

	Abstract = {In recent years improvements to existing programs and the introduction of new iterative algorithms have changed the state-of-the-art in protein sequence alignment. This paper presents the first systematic study of the most commonly used alignment programs using BAliBASE benchmark alignments as test cases. Even below the 'twilight zone' at 10-20\% residue identity, the best programs were capable of correctly aligning on average 47\% of the residues. We show that iterative algorithms often offer improved alignment accuracy though at the expense of computation time. A notable exception was the effect of introducing a single divergent sequence into a set of closely related sequences, causing the iteration to diverge away from the best alignment. Global alignment programs generally performed better than local methods, except in the presence of large N/C-terminal extensions and internal insertions. In these cases, a local algorithm was more successful in identifying the most conserved motifs. This study enables us to propose appropriate alignment strategies, depending on the nature of a particular set of sequences. The employment of more than one program based on different alignment techniques should significantly improve the quality of automatic protein sequence alignment methods. The results also indicate guidelines for improvement of alignment algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Human and mouse genome sequences contain roughly 100,000 regions that are unalignable in primary sequence and neighbor corresponding alignable regions between both organisms. These pairs are generally assumed to be nonconserved, although the level of structural conservation between these has never been investigated. Owing to the limitations in computational methods, comparative genomics has been lacking the ability to compare such nonconserved sequence regions for conserved structural RNA elements. We have investigated the presence of structural RNA elements by conducting a local structural alignment, using FOLDALIGN, on a subset of these 100,000 corresponding regions and estimate that 1800 contain common RNA structures. Comparing our results with the recent mapping of transcribed fragments (transfrags) in human, we find that high-scoring candidates are twice as likely to be found in regions overlapped by transfrags than regions that are not overlapped by transfrags. To verify the coexpression between predicted candidates in human and mouse, we conducted expression studies by RT-PCR and Northern blotting on mouse candidates, which overlap with transfrags on human chromosome 20. RT-PCR results confirmed expression of 32 out of 36 candidates, whereas Northern blots confirmed four out of 12 candidates. Furthermore, many RT-PCR results indicate differential expression in different tissues. Hence, our findings suggest that there are corresponding regions between human and mouse, which contain expressed non-coding RNA sequences not alignable in primary sequence.},

@article{Torarinsson2008,
	Abstract = {Recent computational scans for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in multiple organisms have relied on existing multiple sequence alignments. However, as sequence similarity drops, a key signal of RNA structure-frequent compensating base changes-is increasingly likely to cause sequence-based alignment methods to misalign, or even refuse to align, homologous ncRNAs, consequently obscuring that structural signal. We have used CMfinder, a structure-oriented local alignment tool, to search the ENCODE regions of vertebrate multiple alignments. In agreement with other studies, we find a large number of potential RNA structures in the ENCODE regions. We report 6587 candidate regions with an estimated false-positive rate of 50\%. More intriguingly, many of these candidates may be better represented by alignments taking the RNA secondary structure into account than those based on primary sequence alone, often quite dramatically. For example, approximately one-quarter of our predicted motifs show revisions in >50\% of their aligned positions. Furthermore, our results are strongly complementary to those discovered by sequence-alignment-based approaches-84\% of our candidates are not covered by Washietl et al., increasing the number of ncRNA candidates in the ENCODE region by 32\%. In a group of 11 ncRNA candidates that were tested by RT-PCR, 10 were confirmed to be present as RNA transcripts in human tissue, and most show evidence of significant differential expression across tissues. Our results broadly suggest caution in any analysis relying on multiple sequence alignments in less well-conserved regions, clearly support growing appreciation for the biological significance of ncRNAs, and strongly support the argument for considering RNA structure directly in any searches for these elements.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or `reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.Availability: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.eduContact: cole@cs.umd.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {The combination of incessant advances in sequencing technology producing large amounts of data and innovative bioinformatics approaches, designed to cope with this data flood, has led to new interesting results in the life sciences. Given the magnitude of sequence data to be processed, many bioinformatics tools rely on efficient solutions to a variety of complex string problems. These solutions include fast heuristic algorithms and advanced data structures, generally referred to as index structures. Although the importance of index structures is generally known to the bioinformatics community, the design and potency of these data structures, as well as their properties and limitations, are less understood. Moreover, the last decade has seen a boom in the number of variant index structures featuring complex and diverse memory-time trade-offs. This article brings a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview of the most popular index structures and their recently developed variants. Their features, interrelationships, the trade-offs they impose, but also their practical limitations, are explained and compared.},

@article{Washietl2007,
	Abstract = {Functional RNA structures play an important role both in the context of noncoding RNA transcripts as well as regulatory elements in mRNAs. Here we present a computational study to detect functional RNA structures within the ENCODE regions of the human genome. Since structural RNAs in general lack characteristic signals in primary sequence, comparative approaches evaluating evolutionary conservation of structures are most promising. We have used three recently introduced programs based on either phylogenetic-stochastic context-free grammar (EvoFold) or energy directed folding (RNAz and AlifoldZ), yielding several thousand candidate structures (corresponding to approximately 2.7\% of the ENCODE regions). EvoFold has its highest sensitivity in highly conserved and relatively AU-rich regions, while RNAz favors slightly GC-rich regions, resulting in a relatively small overlap between methods. Comparison with the GENCODE annotation points to functional RNAs in all genomic contexts, with a slightly increased density in 3'-UTRs. While we estimate a significant false discovery rate of approximately 50\%-70\% many of the predictions can be further substantiated by additional criteria: 248 loci are predicted by both RNAz and EvoFold, and an additional 239 RNAz or EvoFold predictions are supported by the (more stringent) AlifoldZ algorithm. Five hundred seventy RNAz structure predictions fall into regions that show signs of selection pressure also on the sequence level (i.e., conserved elements). More than 700 predictions overlap with noncoding transcripts detected by oligonucleotide tiling arrays. One hundred seventy-five selected candidates were tested by RT-PCR in six tissues, and expression could be verified in 43 cases (24.6\%).},

The resulting alignments are found in order of score, with the highest scoring alignment first. In the case of single gaps or multiple gaps weighted linear with gap length, the algorithm is extremely efficient, taking very little time beyond that of the initial calculation of the matrix. The algorithm is applied to comparisons of tRNA-rRNA sequences from Escherichia coli. A statistical analysis is important for proper evaluation of the results, which differ substantially from the results of an earlier analysis of the same sequences by Bloch and colleagues.},

	Abstract = {Second-generation sequencing technologies deliver DNA sequence data at unprecedented high throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. Due to the large amounts of data, efficient algorithms and implementations are crucial for this task. We present an efficient read mapping tool called RazerS. It allows the user to align sequencing reads of arbitrary length using either the Hamming distance or the edit distance. Our tool can work either lossless or with a user-defined loss rate at higher speeds. Given the loss rate, we present an approach that guarantees not to lose more reads than specified. This enables the user to adapt to the problem at hand and provides a seamless tradeoff between sensitivity and running time.},

	Abstract = {mRNA molecules are folded in the cells and therefore many of their substrings may actually be inaccessible to protein and microRNA binding. The need to apply an accessibility criterion to the task of genome-wide mRNA motif discovery raises the challenge of overcoming the core O(n(3)) factor imposed by the time complexity of the currently best known algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction. We speed up the dynamic programming algorithms that are standard for RNA folding prediction. Our new approach significantly reduces the computations without sacrificing the optimality of the results, yielding an expected time complexity of O(n(2) psi(n)), where psi(n) is shown to be constant on average under standard polymer folding models. A benchmark analysis confirms that in practice the runtime ratio between the previous approach and the new algorithm indeed grows linearly with increasing sequence size. The fast new RNA folding algorithm is utilized for genome-wide discovery of accessible cis-regulatory motifs in data sets of ribosomal densities and decay rates of S. cerevisiae genes and to the mining of exposed binding sites of tissue-specific microRNAs in A. thaliana.},

	Abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

	Abstract = {Improved thermodynamic parameters for prediction of RNA duplex formation are derived from optical melting studies of 90 oligoribonucleotide duplexes containing only Watson-Crick base pairs. To test end or base composition effects, new sets of duplexes are included that have identical nearest neighbors, but different base compositions and therefore different ends. Duplexes with terminal GC pairs are more stable than duplexes with the same nearest neighbors but terminal AU pairs. Penalizing terminal AU base pairs by 0.45 kcal/mol relative to terminal GC base pairs significantly improves predictions of DeltaG degrees37 from a nearest-neighbor model. A physical model is suggested in which the differential treatment of AU and GC ends accounts for the dependence of the total number of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds on the base composition of a duplex. On average, the new parameters predict DeltaG degrees37, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS degrees, and TM within 3.2\%, 6.0\%, 6.8\%, and 1.3 degreesC, respectively. These predictions are within the limit of the model, based on experimental results for duplexes predicted to have identical thermodynamic parameters.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent studies have uncovered an "RNA world", in which non coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. Computational studies on ncRNA have been directed toward developing detection methods for ncRNAs. State-of-the-art methods for the problem, like covariance models, suffer from high computational cost, underscoring the need for efficient filtering approaches that can identify promising sequence segments and speedup the detection process. RESULTS: In this paper we make several contributions toward this goal. First, we formalize the concept of a filter and provide figures of merit that allow comparison between filters. Second, we design efficient sequence based filters that dominate the current state-of-the-art HMM filters. Third, we provide a new formulation of the covariance model that allows speeding up RNA alignment. We demonstrate the power of our approach on both synthetic data and real bacterial genomes. We then apply our algorithm to the detection of novel riboswitch elements from the whole bacterial and archaeal genomes. Our results point to a number of novel riboswitch candidates, and include genomes that were not previously known to contain riboswitches.

Our results indicate that computing an optimal alignment under this constraint is very expensive. However, less rigorous conditions on the alignment can be guaranteed by quite efficient algorithms.

@article{Zhang1999,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The local alignment problem for two sequences requires determining similar regions, one from each sequence, and aligning those regions. For alignments computed by dynamic programming, current approaches for selecting similar regions may have potential flaws. For instance, the criterion of Smith and Waterman can lead to inclusion of an arbitrarily poor internal segment. Other approaches can generate an alignment scoring less than some of its internal segments. RESULTS: We develop an algorithm that decomposes a long alignment into sub-alignments that avoid these potential imperfections. Our algorithm runs in time proportional to the original alignment's length. Practical applications to alignments of genomic DNA sequences are described.},

We introduce a new greedy alignment algorithm with particularly good performance and show that it computes the same alignment as does a certain dynamic programming algorithm, while executing over 10 times faster on appropriate data. An implementation of this algorithm is currently used in a program that assembles the UniGene database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.},

We introduce permuted variable length Markov models (PVLMM) which could capture the potentially important dependencies among positions and apply them to the problem of detecting splice and TFB sites. They have been satisfactory from the viewpoint of prediction performance and also give ready biological interpretations of the sequence dependence observed. The issue of model selection is also studied.},

	Abstract = {The abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely related software applications available on the World Wide Web (WWW) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. The objective of this web server is to provide easy access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. Detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. A variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. This URL will be referred to as 'MFOLDROOT'.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new computer method for folding an RNA molecule that finds a conformation of minimum free energy using published values of stacking and destabilizing energies. It is based on a dynamic programming algorithm from applied mathematics, and is much more efficient, faster, and can fold larger molecules than procedures which have appeared up to now in the biological literature. Its power is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain messenger RNA fragment. We go beyond the basic method to show how to incorporate additional information into the algorithm. This includes data on chemical reactivity and enzyme susceptibility. We illustrate this with the folding of two large fragments from the 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli.},
