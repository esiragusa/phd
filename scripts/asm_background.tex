\subsection{Motivation}
%\subsection{History of sequencing}

This work has been motivated by recent advances of molecular genetics.
The human genome has been sequenced in 2001. Also mouse, drosophila, etc.
Nowadays \# reference model genomes are available in genbank.

Next-generation sequencing has been the second revolution.
NGS produces billions of reads for 1000\$ dollars.
Why should one re-sequence a known genome?
Resequencing applications include variant calling, etc.
So NGS impacts biomedicine.

Given a set of reads, two approaches are possible: assembly and mapping.

Assembly methods are based on overlaps, de brujin graphs, or...

Read mapping methods work on a previously assembled reference genome.

The typical SNPs analysis pipeline \ref{fig:ngs-pipeline} consists of...

In this work we focus on read mapping, although many core algorithms considered are also applicable to assembly, as well as to later pipeline stages.

% --- Problem definition ---

\subsection{Problem definition}

We define formally the basic objects alphabet and word.
We call alphabet a finite set of symbols, we denote it as $\Sigma$.
We call word a sequence of symbols over an alphabet. We denote a word $w$ over $\Sigma^{*}$.

Define distance.
Let $d$ be a distance function over words, defined as $d : (\Sigma^{*}, \Sigma^{*}) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$.
Common distance metrics are the Hamming and Levenshtein or edit distance.

$d_H = $

$d_E = $

Define occurrence.
We say that a word $p$ of length $m$ occurs in another word $t$ at position $e$ if $t_{e-m, e} = p$.
The notion of occurrence can be generalized to metric distances...

Define approximate string matching.
Given two words $t$ and $p$ such that $t \gg p$, respectively called text and pattern. Given a distance threshold $k \in \mathcal{N}$.
The approximate string matching problem is to find all occurrences of $p$ into $t$ within the error threshold $k$.

These definitions allow us to model basic biological.

\section{Overview of existing methods}

Existing methods can be classified in three categories: online, indexed and filtering.
Online and filtering in \cite{Navarro1998}. Indexed in \cite{Navarro2001}.

% --- Online methods ---

\subsection{Online methods}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Programming}

The edit distance between two strings can be efficiently computed via dynamic programming.

The recurrence relation is as follows: $D[i,j] = \dots$

Answering the question whether the distance $d(x,y) \leq k$ is an easier problem: a band of size $k+1$ is sufficient.

Finding all occurrences of a pattern $p$ in a text $t$...

Change initialization.

Change traceback to start from all $j : D[m,j] \leq k$.
