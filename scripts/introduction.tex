\section{Motivation}

This work has been motivated by recent advances of molecular genetics.
The human genome has been sequenced in 2001. Also mouse, drosophila, etc.
Nowadays \# reference model genomes are available in genbank.

Next-generation sequencing has been the second revolution.
NGS produces billions of reads for 1000\$ dollars.
Why should one re-sequence a known genome?
Resequencing applications include variant calling, etc.
So NGS impacts biomedicine.

Given a set of reads, two approaches are possible: assembly and mapping.

Assembly methods are based on overlaps, de brujin graphs, or...

Read mapping methods work on a previously assembled reference genome.

The typical SNPs analysis pipeline~\ref{fig:ngs-pipeline} consists of...

In this work we focus on read mapping, although many core algorithms considered are also applicable to assembly, as well as to later pipeline stages.

\item Plan A: de-novo assembly
\item Plan B: reference mapping
\item Plan C: reference guided de-novo assembly
