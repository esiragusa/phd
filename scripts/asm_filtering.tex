\chapter{Filtering methods}
\label{sec:filter}

In this chapter, I present various filtering methods for approximate string matching.
I consider two classes of filtering methods: those based on \emph{seeds} and those based on \emph{$q$-grams}.
Filters of the former class partition the pattern into \emph{non-overlapping} factors called seeds, while filters of the latter class consider all \emph{overlapping} substrings of the pattern having length $q$, the so-called $q$-grams.
Both classes include various combinatorial filtering methods of increasing specificity and complexity, always providing filtration schemes with guarantees on filtration sensitivity.

I present two seed filtering methods:
%\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\emph{exact seeds} \citep{Baeza1992}, and
\emph{approximate seeds} \citep{Myers1994,Navarro2000}.
%\emph{suffix filters} \citep{Kaerkkaeinen2007}.
%\end{inparaenum}
Exact seeds partition the pattern in $k+1$ non-overlapping seeds, to be searched exactly.
Approximate seeds increase specificity by factorizing the pattern in less than $k+1$ non-overlapping seeds, to be searched within a smaller distance threshold.
%Suffix filters further generalize exact and approximate seeds and yield stronger index based filtration.

I present the following $q$-gram filtering methods:
%\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\emph{contiguous $q$-grams} \citep{Jokinen1991},
\emph{gapped $q$-grams} \citep{Burkhardt2001}, and
\emph{multiple gapped $q$-grams} (also called \emph{$q$-gram families}) \citep{Kucherov2005}.
%\end{inparaenum}
Contiguous $q$-grams rely on counting arguments to filter out text regions containing less than a given threshold of $q$-gram occurrences.
Gapped $q$-grams introduce \emph{don't care positions} to lower the correlation between occurrences of consecutive $q$-grams.
Multiple gapped $q$-grams adopt multiple patterns of don't care positions to further increase specificity.

It will become clear through this chapter that seed filters are more practical, flexible, straightforward to design and implement than $q$-gram filters.
All seed filters provide full-sensitive filtration schemes for the $k$-differences problem, while (multiple) gapped $q$-grams only for $k$-mismatches.
The design of highly specific yet full-sensitive filtration schemes for $q$-gram filters is combinatorially hard, while it is quite straightforward for seed filters.
Also implementation-wise, $q$-gram filters are more involved than seeds filter.
In fact, seed filters lend themselves well to both online and offline variants of the problem, while $q$-gram filters are better suited for the online variant.
Finally, the experimental evaluation shows that seed filters outperform $q$-gram filters for most practical inputs.
For these reasons, I design the applications of chapters \ref{sec:masai} and \ref{sec:yara} around seed filtering methods.

%Problems of exact and approximate seeds filters are that: it is not evident which factorization yields optimal filtration, and they yield duplicate occurrences whenever errors are not distributed in the worst-case combination.
%The drawback is that the effort to implement them is slightly higher.

%In the following of this chapter I first present (multiple) gapped $q$-grams and problems associated with their design.
%Then I move to more practical approximate seeds, which I will adopt later in chapter~\ref{chap:map-eng}.
%Finally I discuss suffix filters and their practicality.

%Overall, through this chapter:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item I present a framework for the design of (multiple) gapped $q$-grams consisting of efficient exact and approximate solutions;
%\item I provide generic parallel implementations of filters based on exact and approximate seeds;
%\item I evaluate these filtration schemes in practice.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Exact seeds}
\label{sec:filtering:exact}

Filtration with exact seeds is one of the na\"ivest filtering methods for approximate string matching.
I first explain the underlying combinatorial principle, then I discuss implementation details and lastly give some insights on the efficiency of this method.

\subsection{Principle}

I consider the case of two arbitrary strings $x,y$ within edit distance $k$.
The generalization to $k$-differences is straightforward.

%If I partition \wlogs $y$ into $k+1$ non-overlapping seeds, then at least one seed will occur as a factor of $x$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:exact-seeds}
\citep{Baeza1992}
Let $x,y$ be two strings \st $d_E(x,y) = k$.
%If $y=y^1 y^2 \dots y^{k+1}$ then $x=ay^ib$ for some $a, b$.
If $y$ is partitioned \wlogs into $k+1$ non-overlapping seeds, then at least one seed occurs as a factor of $x$.
\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%I proceed by induction on $k$.
%For $k=0$, the string $y$ is partitioned into one factor, $y$ itself.
%The condition $d_E(x,y) = 0$ implies $x=y$, which is true for $a=\epsilon$ and $b=\epsilon$.
%I suppose the case $k=j-1$ to be true, thus since $d_E(x,y) = j-1$ and $y=y^1 y^2 \dots y^{j}$ then $x=ay^ib$ for some $a, b$.
%I consider the case $k=j$. The $j$-th error can be in
%\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
%\item\label{lemma:exact-seeds:prefix} $y^1\dots y^{i-1}$,
%\item\label{lemma:exact-seeds:infix} $y^i$, or
%\item\label{lemma:exact-seeds:suffix} $y^{i+1}\dots y^{j}$.
%\end{inparaenum}
%In case~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds:prefix} or~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds:suffix}, $x=ay^ib$ clearly holds.
%In case~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds:infix}, if I partition $y^i$ in two factors $y^{i'}$ and $y^{i''}$, then either $x=ay^{i'}b'$ or $x={a'}y^{i''}b$.
%\end{proof}
It is immediate to see that any edit distance error can cover at most one seed.
Therefore, at least one seed of $y$ will not be covered by any seed and hence occur as a factor of $x$.
Figure~\ref{fig:seeds-ext} shows an example.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\caption[Filtration with exact seeds]{Filtration with 6 exact seeds solves $5$-differences. In the illustration, pattern $p$ occurs in text $t$ at edit distance 5. The seed in grey is not covered by any error and thus preserved.}
\label{fig:seeds-ext}
\input{figures/filtration_exact.tikz}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This filtering method reduces the approximate search into multiple smaller exact searches.
It solves $k$-differences by partitioning the pattern into $k+1$ seeds, searching all seeds in the text, and verifying a text window around each occurrence of any seed in the text.
As lemma~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds} is valid for \emph{any substring} of the text within distance $k$ from the pattern, this method finds all approximate occurrences of the pattern in the text.

%\subsection{Implementation}
%\subsubsection{Filtration step}
%Due to its simplicity, this filtering method lends itself to both online and offline implementations.
%In the online implementation, all seeds are preprocessed \eg in a  index.
%In the offline implementation, seeds are looked up in the text index.

%\subsubsection{Redundancy}
%
%Redundancy is a practical problem of seed filters.
%Whenever errors are not distributed according to a worst-case combination for lemma~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds}, more than one seed reports the same candidate location.
%For instance, if two errors fall in the same seed, then at least two seeds will occur exactly.
%
%In practice, redundancy can be avoided either before or after the verification step.
%In the first case, any diagonal in the implicit DP matrix identifies a distinct pattern occurrence to be verified only once.
%All candidate locations of a pattern have to be collected, then sorted by diagonal position and checked.
%Alternatively, if the verification algorithm is fast or the number of redundant candidate locations is low, it is more appealing to verify candidate locations directly.
%Any two pattern occurrences beginning or ending at the same location in the text are redundant.
%To avoid reporting duplicate occurrences, all pattern occurrences have to be collected, sorted and checked.
%
%How many redundant error configurations are produced by filtration with exact seeds?
%Here I consider the fraction of redundant error combinations, not the fraction of redundant candidate locations reported by the filter.
%For simplicity, I consider only combinations of exactly $k$ errors.
%Filtration has to cover all possible ways of distributing $k$ errors among $k+1$ seeds, that is $\binom{2k}{k}$ error combinations.
%However, a fixed seed covers all combinations where the seed itself contains no errors and all $k$ errors are distributed among the remaining $k$ seeds, \ie $\binom{2k-1}{k}$ error combinations.
%Thus the fraction of error combinations covered by filtration with exact seeds over the minimal ones is
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{(k+1)\binom{2k-1}{k}}{\binom{2k}{k}} = \frac{k+1}{2}.
%\end{equation}
%For instance, when $k=5$, filtration with exact seeds covers 3 times more combinations than required.

\subsection{Efficiency}
\label{sec:filtering:exact:efficiency}

The efficiency of filtration with exact seeds clearly depends on the number of verifications produced, as filtration time is always $\Oh(m)$.
Thus, how many verifications does this filtering method trigger?
It is straightforward to derive the expected number of verifications under the assumption of the text being generated according to the uniform Bernoulli model.
I introduce the random variable $C$, counting the number of occurrences of a word in a text.
The emission probability of any symbol in $\Sigma$ is $p = \frac{1}{\sigma}$ and under \iid assumptions the emission (and occurrence) probability of any word of length $q$ is simply
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Pr}(C > 0) = \frac{1}{\sigma^q}
\end{eqnarray}
thus the expected number of occurrences of a seed of length $q$ in a text of length $n$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
E[C] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-q+1}{\text{Pr}(C > 0)} = \frac{n - q + 1}{\sigma^q} \leq \frac{n}{\sigma^q}.
\end{eqnarray}

Lemma~\ref{lemma:exact-seeds} requires to partition the pattern into $k+1$ seeds but leaves the freedom to choose their length.
This leads to the problem of finding an optimal pattern partitioning to minimize the expected number of verifications.
I fix\footnote{For simplicity I ignore that some seed could have length $\left \lceil \frac{m}{k+1} \right \rceil$.} the length of all seeds to be
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:seed-len}
q=\left \lfloor \frac{m}{k+1} \right \rfloor
\end{eqnarray}
to minimize the expected number of occurrences of any seed.
Under these conditions, the expected number of verifications produced by filtration with exact seeds is
\begin{eqnarray}
E[V] = E[C] \cdot (k + 1) < \frac{n (k + 1)}{\sigma^q}.
\end{eqnarray}
Nonetheless, inputs of practical interest like genomes and natural texts do not fit well the uniform Bernoulli model.
On those texts, uniform seed length often leads to suboptimal filtration.

%\subsubsection{Expected sublinearity}
%I now turn to the effect of the error rate on the runtime of the resulting $k$-differences algorithm.
%For which error rate the resulting algorithm is expected to have \emph{sublinear} runtime?
%\citeauthor{Gusfield1997} gives a rough estimate to this question.
%If the classic $\Oh(m^2)$ DP algorithm of section~\ref{sub:introonline} is adopted to verify candidate locations, the expected runtime must be
%\begin{eqnarray}
%E[V] \cdot m^2 < cn
%\end{eqnarray}
%for some constant $c$.
%Substituting $E[V]$ and solving for $q$ yields
%\begin{eqnarray}
%q > \log_{\sigma}{\frac{m^3}{c}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%and since $q$ in equation~\ref{eq:seed-len} is a function of $m$ and $k$, it follows that
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\epsilon = \frac{k}{m} < \frac{m}{\log_{\sigma}{m}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%is the error rate for which this $k$-differences algorithm has expected sublinear runtime.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Approximate seeds}
\label{sec:seeds-apx}

The simple analysis of section~\ref{sec:filtering:exact:efficiency} shows that filtration specificity is strongly correlated to the seed length.
Therefore, the crux of designing a stronger filter lies into increasing the seed length while maintaining the full-sensitivity constrains.
\citeauthor{Myers1994}, subsequently followed by \citeauthor{Navarro2000}, proposed \emph{approximate seeds} as a practical and effective generalization of exact seeds, yielding stronger filters for $k$-differences.
The key idea of filtration with approximate seeds is to reduce the approximate search into smaller approximate searches, as opposed to filtration with exact seeds that reduces into smaller exact searches.

\subsection{Principle}

Again, I start by considering two arbitrary strings $x,y$ within edit distance $k$.
The result then holds for any substring of the text within distance $k$ from the pattern.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:apx-seeds}
\citep{Myers1994,Navarro2000}
Let $x,y$ be two strings \st $d_E(x,y) = k$.
If $y$ is partitioned \wlogs into $s$ non-overlapping seeds \st $1 \leq s \leq k+1$, then at least one seed occurs as a factor of $x$ within distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor$.
\end{lemma}
To prove full-sensitivity it suffices to see that, if none of the seeds occurs within its assigned distance, the total distance must be greater than $s \cdot \lfloor k/s \rfloor = k$.
Figure~\ref{fig:seeds-apx} illustrates.

Approximate seeds provide filtration of variable specificity.
The fastest but weakest filtration is given by $s=k+1$, while the most specific filtration is obtained for $s=1$ \ie perfect filtration without any verification step.
Alternatively, filtration specificity is controlled by acting on the minimum seed length $q$.
Fixing $q$ yields $s = \lfloor m/q \rfloor$, or vice versa, fixing the number of seeds $s$ gives $q =\lfloor m/s \rfloor$.
Filtration specificity is expected to increase with seed length.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\caption[Filtration with approximate seeds]{Filtration with approximate seeds. A filtration scheme with thresholds $\mathbf{t} = (1,1,1)$ solves $5$-difference. In the illustration, pattern $p$ occurs in text $t$ at edit distance 5. The seed in grey is covered by only one error and thus preserved.}
\label{fig:seeds-apx}
\input{figures/filtration_apx.tikz}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%\begin{lemma}
%\label{lemma:apx-seeds-var}
%Let $x,y$ be two strings \st $d_E(x,y) = k$.
%Partition $y$ into $s$ non-overlapping seeds $y^1, y^2, \dots, y^s$.
%Assign an arbitrary distance threshold $k_i$ to each seed $y^i$, satisfying the following constraint:
%\begin{equation}
%s + \sum_{i=1}^{s}{k_i} > k.
%\end{equation}
%Then at least one seed occurs as a factor of $x$ within distance $k_i$.
%\end{lemma}

\subsection{Filtration schemes}

Lemma \ref{lemma:apx-seeds} assigns the same distance threshold to all seeds, yet this is not obligatory.
Hence, I give a more general definition of \emph{filtration scheme} for approximate seeds.
\begin{definition}
A seeds filtration scheme is an integer vector $\mathbf{t} = (t_1, \dots, t_s)$, where integer $t_i \in \N_0$ represents the threshold assigned to the $i$-th seed.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:apx-scheme}
Any filtration scheme $\mathbf{t} = (t_1, \dots, t_s)$ \st
\begin{eqnarray}
s + \sum_{i=1}^s t_i > k
\end{eqnarray}
is full-sensitive for $k$-differences (and $k$-mismatches).
\end{lemma}
%I say that a \emph{full-sensitive} filtration scheme \emph{solves} a $k$-differences instance.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:seeds-apx-scheme}
The filtration schemes $(0,0,0,0,0)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(4)$ are full-sensitive for $4$-differences.
%or any their permutation
For instance, given a pattern of length $m=100$, according to equation~\ref{eq:seed-len}, $q$ is respectively $20, 33, 50, 100$.
\end{example}

How to choose a \emph{good} filtration scheme in practice?
\cite{Myers1994}, \cite{Navarro2000} carried out involved analysis to estimate the optimal parameterization. \citeauthor{Navarro2000} find out that a number of seeds of $\Theta(\frac{m}{\log_{\sigma}{n}})$ yields an overall time complexity sublinear for an error rate $\epsilon < 1 - \frac{e}{\sqrt{\sigma}}$.
\citeauthor{Myers1994} reports an analogous sublinear time when $q=\Theta(\log_{\sigma}{n})$ is the seed length.
Yet, these results do not necessarily translate into optimal filtration schemes in practice.
The parameterization depends on the full-text index, the verification algorithm, the statistical properties of the text.
Missing the optimal number of seeds by one often results in a runtime penalty of an order of magnitude.

Having established the number of seeds, or their length, thresholds have to be assigned.
Lemma \ref{lemma:apx-scheme} allows to assign arbitrary distance thresholds.
In practice, it is convenient to distribute distance thresholds evenly, as seeds with the highest threshold dominate the overall filtration time.
The most strict threshold assignment is to give distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor$ to $(k \bmod{s}) + 1$ seeds and distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor - 1$ to the remaining seeds \citep{Siragusa2013}.

\section{Contiguous $q$-grams}
\label{sec:filtering:qgrams-ext}

$q$-Gram filters rely on counting arguments to filter out text regions containing less than a given threshold of $q$-gram occurrences.
The first $q$-gram counting filter for approximate string matching has been proposed in \citep{Jokinen1991}.
Filters for more general alignment problems have been proposed and implemented in \emph{QUASAR} \citep{Burkhardt1999}, \emph{SWIFT} \citep{Rasmussen2006}, and \emph{STELLAR} \citep{Kehr2011}.

\subsection{Principle}

The counting argument of contiguous $q$-gram filters is based on \emph{$q$-gram similarity}: the number of substrings of length $q$ common to two given strings.
The following lemma relates $q$-gram similarity to edit distance, by giving a \emph{lower bound} on the $q$-gram similarity of any two strings $x,y$ within edit distance $k$.
As for seed filters, this result then easily translates to $k$-differences.

\begin{lemma}[The $q$-gram lemma] \citep{Jokinen1991}
\label{lemma:qgrams}
Let $x,y$ be two strings \st $d_E(x,y) = k$, and assume \wlogs $|x| \leq |y|$ and $|x| = m$. Then $x$ and $y$ have $q$-gram similarity $\tau_q(m,k) \geq m - q + 1 - kq$.
\end{lemma}
The threshold function $\tau_q$ of a $q$-gram depends only on parameters $(m,k)$.
The first part of the threshold function $\tau_q$ counts the number of $q$-grams of $x$ (\ie $m - q + 1$), while the second part counts how many $q$-grams can be covered by $k$ errors (\ie at most $q$ per error, hence $kq$ in total).
Indeed, only the positions of errors in the transcript determine which $q$-grams are covered or preserved, while text and pattern characters are irrelevant.
Figure~\ref{fig:qgrams-ext} exemplifies.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\caption[Filtration with contiguous $q$-grams]{Filtration with contiguous $q$-grams. A filtration scheme $(q,t) = (4,2)$ solves the instance $(25,5)$. In the illustration, pattern $p$ of length 25 occurs in text $t$ at edit distance 5. The two grey $q$-grams are preserved.}
\label{fig:qgrams-ext}
\input{figures/filtration_qgrams.tikz}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Filtration schemes}

I denote by pair $(q,t)$ the filtration scheme using $q$-grams with threshold $t$.
According to lemma \ref{lemma:qgrams}, if $t = \tau_q(m,k) \geq 1$, then $(q,t)$ is full-sensitive for any $k$-differences instance where $|p|=m$, thus I say that $(q,t)$ \emph{solves} instance $(m,k)$.

The following question then arises: which is the longest $q$-gram solving instance $(m,k)$?
In order to satisfy lemma~\ref{lemma:qgrams}, the $q$-gram threshold must be greater than zero, \ie it must hold $\tau_q(m,k) \geq 1$.
Thus, by substituting $\tau_q(m,k)$, it follows that the $q$-gram length must be $q \leq \left \lfloor \frac{m}{k+1} \right \rfloor$, analogously to seed filters (see equation~\ref{eq:seed-len}).

However, the longest $q$-gram does not yield always the most specific filtration scheme.
For instance, a threshold of 1 completely discards the counting argument of lemma~\ref{lemma:qgrams} and makes filtration very unspecific in practice.
Hence, on certain $(m,k)$ instances, filtration schemes with non-optimal $q$-gram length yield more specific filtration.
Example \ref{ex:qgrams-ext-scheme} shows alternative filtration schemes solving a given $(m,k)$ instance.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:qgrams-ext-scheme}
The following $(q,t)$ filtration schemes solve $(100,4)$-differences:
$(20,1)$, $(19,6)$, $(18,11)$.
%or any their permutation
\end{example}

%\subsection{Implementation}
\subsection{Bucketing}

Filtration with $q$-grams requires \emph{bucketing} the text in windows, in order to enforce the counting argument of lemma \ref{lemma:qgrams}.
Buckets are obtained by subdividing the implicit DP matrix in parallelograms and projecting them on the text.
Figure \ref{fig:swift} illustrates this concept: any approximate occurrence of the pattern in the text spans at most $k$ diagonals and is thus enclosed inside a parallelogram of width $k+1$ \citep{Rasmussen2006}.
Hence the projection of any text bucket has length $2k + 1$ and any occurrence has length between $m - k$ and $m + k$.
The implementations described in \citep{Rasmussen2006, Kehr2011, Weese2009} use more efficient bucketing strategies with larger, overlapping parallelograms.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\caption[Parallelogram buckets] {Parallelogram buckets. Picture from \citep{Weese2009}.}
\label{fig:swift}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/swift.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This method lends itself to work in a multiple online fashion rather than offline.
The filtration stage scans the text and counts how many $q$-grams of each pattern fall into each parallelogram bucket.
As long as the filter proceeds, it remembers only the buckets that span the patterns' lengths.
The verification stage then verifies only parallelograms exceeding threshold $t$.
Conversely, the program QUASAR \citep{Burkhardt1999} uses a $q$-gram index of the text to speed up the filtration phase.
Such implementation requires more memory, as it must keep the text index in memory and bucket the whole text.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Gapped $q$-grams}
\label{sec:filtering:qgrams-gapped}

\emph{Gapped $q$-grams} for approximate string matching have been proposed by \cite{Burkhardt2001}.
The idea of \emph{gapped $q$-grams} is to lower the correlation between consecutive $q$-grams.
Indeed, the $q$-gram lemma shows that one single edit distance error affects a cluster of $q$ consecutive $q$-grams.
The occurrence of any contiguous $q$-gram is strongly correlated to the occurrences of its preceding and following $q$-grams.
To lower this correlation, gapped $q$-grams skip characters at fixed positions using patterns of \emph{don't care positions}.
In this way, the occurrence of a gapped $q$-gram remain unaffected by any mismatch falling within its don't care positions.
Filtration specificity increases, because either the $q$-gram threshold or the $q$-gram length can be raised, in either cases preserving full-sensitivity.
Unfortunately, don't care positions are immune to mismatches, but not to insertions and deletions.
Therefore, this generalization of contiguous $q$-grams solves $k$-mismatches, but not $k$-differences.

Gapped $q$-grams rely on a generalization of the $q$-gram similarity measure (section~\ref{sec:filtering:qgrams-ext}) to \emph{subsequences}.
A subsequence is a non-contiguous sequence of symbols of a given string.
Hence, instead of substrings, filtration with gapped $q$-grams counts the number of subsequences of length $q$ common to two strings, whose positions are taken from a fixed set $Q$.
The formal definition of gapped $q$-gram follows.

\begin{definition}
A gapped $q$-gram (abbreviated as $Q$-gram) is a finite sequence $Q$ of natural numbers starting with the unit element, \ie $Q \subset \N$ and $1 \in Q$.
The cardinality $|Q|$ is called the \emph{weight} of $Q$ and denoted as $w(Q)$.
The maximum element of $Q$ is named \emph{span} and indicated by $s(Q)$.
\end{definition}
%In literature, $Q$-grams are visualized as words over the alphabet $\{1,*\}$ or $\{\#,-\}$.
%I adopt the former notation and represent the $Q$-gram by the word $w \in \{1,*\}^{s(Q)}$ such that $w_j=1$ iff $j \in Q$.

Figure~\ref{fig:qgrams-gapped} shows an example of gapped $q$-gram.
As in lemma \ref{lemma:qgrams}, the $Q$-gram threshold $\tau_Q$ depends only on parameters $(m,k)$;
therefore, I refer to filtration schemes $(Q,t)$ solving $(m,k)$ instances.
However, lemma \ref{lemma:qgrams} does not give anymore a tight threshold, but only a lower bound.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\caption[Filtration with gapped $q$-grams]{Filtration with gapped $q$-grams. A filtration scheme $(Q,t) = (\{1, 3, 4, 5\},3)$ solves instance $(25,5)$. In the illustration, pattern $p$ of length 25 occurs in text $t$ at edit distance 5. The three $q$-grams in grey are not covered by any mismatch.}
\label{fig:qgrams-gapped}
\input{figures/filtration_qgrams_gapped.tikz}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To obtain even more specific filtration, \cite{Kucherov2005} propose \emph{$q$-gram families} (or \emph{multiple gapped $q$-grams}) for approximate string matching.
Filtration with a $q$-gram family combines a set of multiple distinct gapped $q$-grams in a disjunctive way.
The generalized counting principle now adds all occurrences of any gapped $q$-gram in the set.
Figure~\ref{fig:qgrams-multiple} illustrates.
\begin{definition}
A $q$-gram family (abbreviated as $\mathbb{F}$-gram) is a finite set $\mathbb{F} = \{ Q_1, \dots, Q_f \}$ of $Q$-grams.
Its counting threshold $\tau_{\mathbb{F}}$ is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_{\mathbb{F}}(m,k) = \sum_{Q_i \in \mathbb{F}}{\tau_{Q_i}(m,k)}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{definition}
For simplicity, in the remaining of this chapter, I refer only to gapped $q$-grams but intend also $q$-gram families.

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{center}
\caption[Filtration with multiple gapped $q$-grams]{Filtration with multiple gapped $q$-grams.

The seven $q$-grams in grey are not covered by any mismatch.}
\label{fig:qgrams-multiple}
\input{figures/filtration_qgrams_multiple.tikz}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design questions}

The design of gapped $q$-grams raises hard combinatorial questions:
\begin{enumerate} %[(i)]
\item \label{enum:qgram-non-detection} Does a gapped $q$-gram yield any filtration scheme solving an $(m,k)$ instance? 
\item If the answer to question~\ref{enum:qgram-non-detection} is yes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enum:qgram-error} Which is the maximum distance $k^*$ for which full-sensitivity is guaranteed?
\item \label{enum:qgram-threshold} Which is the maximum threshold $t^*$ that guarantees full-sensitivity?
\end{enumerate}
\item \label{enum:qgram-fn} If the answer to question~\ref{enum:qgram-non-detection} is no, which is the expected sensitivity of the lossy filtration scheme?
\item \label{enum:qgram-fp} Which is the expected specificity of a filtration scheme?
%If the weight is taken as a simplified criterion predicting filtration efficiency, 
%\item \label{enum:qgram-weight} which is the maximum weight lossless shape?
\end{enumerate}

All of the above questions naturally generalize to $q$-gram families.
Question \ref{enum:qgram-threshold} has been first considered in \citep{Burkhardt2001,Kucherov2005}, the more general question \ref{enum:qgram-non-detection} has been introduced in \citep{Nicolas2005}, while I consider here for the first time questions \ref{enum:qgram-error}, \ref{enum:qgram-fn} and \ref{enum:qgram-fp}.
In order to formalize the above questions, I introduce simple characteristic functions indicating which transcripts are detected by a gapped $q$-gram.
Afterwards, I model each question as a combinatorial problem and provide methods to compute exact or approximate solutions.

\subsection{Characteristic functions}

I consider any Hamming distance transcript over $\{ R, M \}$ as an $m$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots x_m)$ over $\Bo = \{ 0, 1 \}$.
Accordingly, I denote by $|\mathbf{x}|_0=m - \sum \mathbf{x}$ the Hamming distance of the transcript, and by $\Bo^m_k \subset \Bo^m$ the set containing all transcripts $\mathbf{x}$ \st $|\mathbf{x}|_0 = k$.
I now define the event of detection of a transcript by a filtration scheme $(Q,t)$.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:qgram-occ}
A $Q$-gram \emph{occurs} at position $i$ in a transcript $\mathbf{x}$ iff $\forall j \in Q$ $x_{i+j}=1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:qgram-detection}
A filtration scheme $(Q,t)$ \emph{detects} $\mathbf{x}$ iff the $Q$-gram occurs at least $t$ times in $\mathbf{x}$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Boolean functions}

I introduce \emph{boolean functions} that characterize the set of transcripts detected by filtration schemes of the form $(Q,1)$.
The utility of these functions is manyfold.
In section \ref{sub:qgram-optimal-threshold}, I use them within an ILP that computes an exact solution to \textsc{Optimal Threshold} and thus answers \textsc{Non Detection}.
In section \ref{sub:qgram-specificity}, I reduce the estimation of filtration sensitivity to a counting problem on boolean functions.

Let $T_{Q}^{m}: \Bo^m \rightarrow \Bo$ denote a \emph{boolean function} such that $T_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x})$ is true iff the $Q$-gram occurs at least one time in a transcript $\mathbf{x}$ of length $m$.
I define such boolean function as the disjunction
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qgram-bool}
T_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = \bigvee_{i=1}^{m-s(Q)+1} \bigwedge_{j \in Q} x_{i+j}
\end{equation}
where each \emph{clause} of $T_{Q}^{m}$ represents a single possible occurrence of $Q$ in $\mathbf{x}$.
According to definition \ref{def:qgram-occ}, filtration scheme $(Q,t)$ detects $\mathbf{x}$ iff $\mathbf{x}$ satisfies at least $t$ clauses of $T_{Q}^{m}$.
%The seed boolean function $T_{Q}^{m}$ describes the computation performed by the seed automaton $A_Q$ on all transcripts of length $m$.
I define an analogous boolean function for an $\mathbb{F}$-gram as the disjunction
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:family-bool}
T_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = \bigvee_{Q_i \in \mathbb{F}} T_{Q_i}^{m}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}

By construction, $T_{Q}^{m}$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ are boolean functions in \emph{disjunctive normal form} (\emph{DNF}).
Moreover, both functions are \emph{monotone non-decreasing}.
Recall that a boolean function $f : \mathbb{B}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$ is monotone non-decreasing iff 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monotone-non-decreasing}
f(\mathbf{y}) \leq f(\mathbf{y} \vee \mathbf{z}) \quad \forall \, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{B}^m
\end{equation}
Both $T_{Q}^{m}$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ satisfy the above inequality as they do not contain any literal in negated form.
Finally, $T_{Q}^{m}$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ are \emph{minimal} as all monotone boolean functions in DNF are minimal.

\subsubsection{Pseudo-boolean functions}

I now consider \emph{pseudo-boolean functions}, counterparts of functions \ref{eq:qgram-bool} and \ref{eq:family-bool}, that associate a filtration threshold to any transcript.
Let the function $t_{Q}^{m}: \Bo^m \rightarrow \N_0$ be the boolean function $T_{Q}^{m}$ acting on $\N_0$.
I define such \emph{pseudo-boolean function} as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qgram-pseudo}
t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m-s(Q)+1} \prod_{j \in Q} x_{i+j}
\end{equation}
Here, $t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x})$ \emph{counts} how many times a $Q$-gram occurs in a transcript $\mathbf{x}$ of length $m$.
It is useful to define the complementary function $\bar{t}_{Q}^{m}$, counting how many times a $Q$-gram does not occur in a transcript $\mathbf{x}$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qgram-pseudoneg}
\bar{t}_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = m - s(Q) + 1 - t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}
Analogously, I define a pseudo-boolean function for an $\mathbb{F}$-gram as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:family-pseudo}
t_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{Q_i \in \mathbb{F}} t_{Q_i}^{m}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}
along with its complementary function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:family-pseudoneg}
\bar{t}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{Q_i \in \mathbb{F}}{(m - s(Q_i) + 1)} - t_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}

The above pseudo-boolean functions have particular properties in respect to monotonicity and modularity.
The non-decreasing monotonicity of functions $t_{Q}^{m}$ and $t_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ immediately follows from the non-decreasing monotonicity of their boolean counterparts $T_{Q}^{m}$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$.
Consequently, the complementary functions $\bar{t}_{Q}^{m}$ and $\bar{t}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ are \emph{monotone nonincreasing}.

\emph{Supermodularity} and \emph{submodularity} are the discrete analogs of concavity and convexity.
These properties allow to compute in polynomial time approximate solutions to constrained optimization problems.
A pseudo-boolean function $f : \mathbb{B}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is \emph{supermodular} iff 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:supermodularity}
f(\mathbf{y}) + f(\mathbf{z}) \leq f(\mathbf{y} \wedge \mathbf{z}) + f(\mathbf{y} \vee \mathbf{z}) \quad \forall \, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{B}^m,
\end{equation}
or it is \emph{submodular} if $-f$ is supermodular.
An equivalent definition of supermodularity states that all second order derivatives must be non-negative, \ie
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:supermodularity}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z_i \partial z_j}(\mathbf{z}) \geq 0 \quad \forall \, \mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{B}^m \text{ and } \forall \, 1 \leq i \leq j \leq m.
\end{equation}
This latter definition is evident for $t_{Q}^{m}$, as this function does not contain any negative term.
Thus, function $t_{Q}^{m}$ is supermodular and $\bar{t}_{Q}^{m}$ is submodular.
Moreover, since super and submodular functions are closed under non-negative linear combination, functions $t_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ and $\bar{t}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m}$ are still super and submodular.


%\subsection{Submodular Functions}
%Let $E$ be a nonempty finite set and $\mathcal{D}$ be a collection of subsets of $E$ which forms a distributive lattice with set union and intersection as the lattice operations join and meet, i.e. $\forall X,Y \in \mathcal{D}$, we have $X \cup Y$, $X \cap Y \in \mathcal{D}$.
%A set function $f : \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is submodular on the distributive lattice $\mathcal{D}$ iff $\forall X,Y \in \mathcal{D}$
%\begin{equation}
%f(X) + f(Y) \geq f(X \cup Y) + f(X \cap Y)
%\end{equation}
%Alternatively, $f$ is submodular iff $\forall X,Y \in \mathcal{D}$ s.t. $X \subseteq Y$ and $\forall e \in E$ s.t. $e \notin Y$
%\begin{equation}
%f(X \cup \{e\}) - f(X) \geq f(Y \cup \{e\}) - f(Y)
%\end{equation}


\subsection{Full-sensitivity}
\label{sub:qgram-full-sensitivity}

%\textsc{Non Detection}~\citep{Nicolas2005} asks the question: does a given $Q$-gram solve an $(m,k)$ instance?

\subsubsection{Problem definition}

\paragraph{}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
{\bf Instance}	&	A $Q$-gram, an $(m,k)$ instance. \\
{\bf Question}	&	Does it exist a transcript $\mathbf{x} \in \Bo^{m}_{k}$ such that $T_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x})$ is false? \\
\end{tabular}
\\

\subsubsection{Hardness results}

\cite{Nicolas2005} show that \textsc{Non Detection} is \emph{strongly} NP-complete by performing an indirect reduction of \textsc{Exact Cover by 3-Sets} to \textsc{Non Detection}.
Strong NP-completeness implies that no \emph{fully polynomial-time approximation scheme} (FPTAS) nor any \emph{pseudo-polynomial} algorithm for \textsc{Non Detection} exist, under the assumption that $P \neq NP$.
This fact motivates me to give ILP or approximate solutions to optimization and counting problems related to \textsc{Non Detection}.

\subsection{Minimum lossy distance}
\label{sub:qgram-min-lossy-distance}

\subsubsection{Problem definition}

\paragraph{}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
{\bf Instance}	&	A $Q$-gram, an integer $m > 0$.\\
{\bf Solution}	&	The smallest integer $k^*$ such that \textsc{Non Detection} for $Q$, $(m,k^*)$ answers \emph{no}.\\
\end{tabular}
\\

Recalling pseudo-boolean function \ref{eq:qgram-pseudo}, I define this problem as the minimization of a linear function subject to submodular constraints
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & |\mathbf{x}|_0			\\
w.r.t.								\\
& \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^m					\\
& \bar{t}_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) = 0	\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{ILP solution}

I reduce the problem to \textsc{Minimum Set Cover} \citep{Vazirani2001} and solve it with the following ILP
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & \sum \bar{\mathbf{x}}	\\
w.r.t.						\\
& \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^m			\\
& \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \geq \mathbf{b}	\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where the value $A_{ij}$ of the coefficient matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
A_{ij} = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1  & \mbox{if } i-j+1 \in Q		\\
		0  & \mbox{if } i-j+1 \notin Q	\\
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
and $\mathbf{b}$ is the unitary vector $\mathbf{1}^{m - s(Q) + 1}$.
Given the ILP solution $\bar{\mathbf{x}}^*$, the minimum distance for which the $Q$-gram is lossy is $k^* = |\mathbf{x}^*|_0$.

\begin{observation}
Contiguous $q$-grams provide an interesting special case of this ILP.
If $A$ has the \emph{Consecutive Ones Property}, it is \emph{totally unimodular} \citep{Fulkerson1964}.
The \emph{polytope} defined by a totally unimodular coefficient matrix is \emph{integral}.
The optimal solution of the relaxed LP is also the optimal solution of the original ILP.
Hence, this ILP computes the threshold of a contiguous $q$-gram in polynomial time.
\end{observation}

\subsubsection{APX solution}

I propose the greedy algorithm by \cite{Chvatal1979} to compute an approximate solution to \textsc{Minimum Set Cover}.
Algorithm \ref{alg:qgram-maxdist-apx} computes via \emph{gradient descent} a solution with an APX-ratio of $H_{w(Q)}$.

\begin{figure*}[h]

\begin{minipage}[t]{.8\textwidth}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\Algorithm{MinLossyDistance}{$Q,m$}

	\State {$x_i \gets 0$}
	\State {$k \gets k + 1$}
\EndWhile
\State \Return $k$
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:qgram-maxdist-apx}
\end{algorithm}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Optimal threshold}
\label{sub:qgram-optimal-threshold}

%Which is the highest $Q$-gram threshold $t^*$ that guarantees full-sensitivity for a $()$?
%This problem has been introduced in \citep{Burkhardt2001}. %and generalized in \citep{Kucherov2005}.

\subsubsection{Problem definition}

\paragraph{}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
{\bf Instance}	&	A $Q$-gram, an $(m,k)$ instance.\\
{\bf Solution}	&	The largest integer $t^*$ such that $(Q,t^*)$ solves $(m,k)$.\\
\end{tabular}
\\

Recalling $Q$-gram pseudo-boolean functions \ref{eq:qgram-pseudo}, I define \textsc{Optimal Threshold} as the minimization of a supermodular function subject to linear constraints
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & t_{Q}^{m} (\mathbf{x})			\\
w.r.t.								\\
& \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^m_k				\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Recalling $Q$-gram pseudo-boolean functions \ref{eq:qgram-pseudoneg}, I consider the \emph{complementary} \textsc{Optimal Threshold} problem as the maximization of a submodular function subject to linear constraints:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\max & \bar{t}_{Q}^{m} (\mathbf{x})		\\
w.r.t.								\\
& \mathbf{x} \in \bar{\Bo}^m_k			\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Previous results}

\textsc{Optimal Threshold} is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the span of the $Q$-gram.
 \cite{Burkhardt2001} give a DP algorithm computing the optimal threshold in time $\Oh(m \cdot k \cdot 2^{s(Q)})$.
\cite{Kucherov2005} give an extension for $Q$-gram families.

\subsubsection{Exact ILP solution}

I reduce this problem to \textsc{maximum coverage} \citep{Vazirani2001} and solve it with the following ILP
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\max & \sum c_j					\\
w.r.t.							\\
& \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^m_k			\\
& c \in \Bo^{m - s(Q) + 1}		\\
& x_i \geq c_j				\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where variable $c_j$ indicates the truthfulness of the $j$-th clause in $T_{Q}^{m}$.
From the ILP solution $c^*$, I derive the exact solution to \textsc{Optimal Threshold} as $t^* = m - s(Q) + 1 - \sum c^*$.

\subsubsection{APX solution}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:qgram-threshold-apx} computes via \emph{gradient descent} an approximate solution to \textsc{Optimal Threshold}.
This algorithm has an APX-ratio of $1 + 1/e$ \citep{Vazirani2001} for the complementary \textsc{Optimal Threshold} problem.
The same \emph{absolute error} applies to \textsc{Optimal Threshold}.

\end{tabular}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State {$\mathbf{x} \gets \mathbf{1}^m$}
\While {$k > 0$}
	\State {i \gets $ \argmax_{j=1}^{m} \frac{\partial \bar{t}^m_Q(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_j}$}
	\State {$x_i \gets 0$}
	\State {$k \gets k - 1$}
\EndWhile
\State \Return $m - s(Q) + 1 - \bar{t}^m_Q(\mathbf{x})$
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:qgram-threshold-apx}
\end{algorithm}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Specificity}
\label{sub:qgram-specificity}

Which is the expected specificity of a filtration scheme $(Q,t)$?
Assuming the text to be generated according to the uniform Bernoulli model, the expected specificity of a filtration scheme is proportional to the number of detected transcripts.
Among full-sensitive filtration schemes, one that maximizes the expected specificity is preferable.

\subsubsection{Problem definition}

\paragraph{}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
{\bf Instance}	&	A filtration scheme $(Q,t)$, an $(m,k)$ instance.\\
%{\bf Solution}	&	The number of transcripts $\mathbf{x} \in \bar{\Bo}^{m}_{k}$ \st $t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) \geq t$\\
{\bf Solution}	&	The number of transcripts $\mathbf{x} \in \Bo^{m}$ \st $t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) \geq t$\\
\end{tabular}
\\

%False positives are true points of the boolean function \ref{eq:qgram-bool} which have weight inferior to $m-k$ and satisfy more than $t$ clauses of $T_{Q}^{m}$.
%Hence, I define the function $\text{FP}_{k}^{m}$ counting the number of false positives of filter $(Q,t)$ in instance $(m,k)$ as
%\begin{equation}
%\text{FP}_{k}^{m}(Q,t) = \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in {\bar{\Bo}^{m}_{k}}} t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) \geq t
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{FPRAS solution}

I am interested in the number of transcripts:
\begin{equation}
\text{\#P}^{m}(Q,t) = | \{ \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^{m} : t_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) \geq t \} |
\end{equation}
For threshold $t=1$, this number is simply the number of true assignments of $T_{Q}^{m}$:
\begin{equation}
\text{\#P}^{m}(Q,1) = | \{ \mathbf{x} \in \Bo^{m} : T_{Q}^{m}(\mathbf{x}) \} |
\end{equation}
\citeauthor{Karp1989} introduce a \emph{fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme} (FPRAS) \citep{Vazirani2001} to count the number of true assignments of a boolean function in DNF \citep{Karp1989}.
This method is known as \emph{importance sampling} \citep{Vazirani2001}.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:qgram-specificity} works for an arbitrary threshold.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:filtering:evaluation}

In this section, I show the results of an experimental evaluation of all filtration methods exposed so far.
I consider seed filtration schemes with exact, 1 and 2-approximate seeds (Exact, 1-Apx and 2-Apx seeds), contiguous $q$-grams filtration schemes using the maximum lossless value of $q$ for a threshold of 1 ($q$-Grams, $t \geq 1$) and 4 ($q$-Grams, $t \geq 4$).
For indexed filters, I use the $q$-gram index with $q=10$ (see \ref{sec:index:qgram}).
To perform edit distance verifications, I use a banded version of the Myers' algorithm \citep{Myers1999}.
As text, I take the \emph{C.~elegans} reference genome (WormBase WS195), \ie a collection of 6 DNA strings of about 100~Mbp total length.
As patterns, I extrapolated $200k$ DNA sequences of length 100~bp from an Illumina sequencing run (Sequence Read Archive ID SRR065390).

All experiments run on a desktop computer running Linux~3.10.11, equipped with one Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50\,GHz, 32\,GB RAM and a 2\,TB HDD @ 7200\,RPM.
I repeated the experiment for $k$-mismatches and $k$-differences, varying $k$ in the range $[1,10]$.
I measured the runtime of the filtration phase only, and then of the filtration plus verification phase.
The plots show always \emph{average} runtimes (or values) per pattern.

\subsection{Runtime}

Figure \ref{fig:filter-runtime-hamming-celegans} shows the results for $k$-mismatches.
Exact seeds are the best filtration method for $k \leq 7$, mainly due to their superior filtration speed, while 1-approximate seeds are better for $k \geq 8$.
2-Approximate seeds start to dominate exact seeds only for $k \geq 10$, \ie they provide too strong filtration on this text.
Both $q$-gram filtration schemes are always slower than 1-approximate seeds.
It can be seen that enforcing $t \geq 4$ improves the total runtime for those instances where $t \geq 1$ renders the filter too weak.

Figure \ref{fig:filter-runtime-edit-celegans} shows the results for $k$-differences.
The more involved edit distance verification slightly fills the gap between exact seeds and contiguous $q$-grams, yet exact seeds continue to be always the fastest alternative.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}

\includegraphics{filter_runtime.dna.celegans.edit.100}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Verification versus filtration}

Figure \ref{fig:filter-ratio-hamming-celegans} shows the ratios between the runtimes of the verification and filtration phases of each filtration scheme.
For $k \leq 6$, all schemes spend more time on filtration rather than verification.
The weakest scheme, filtration with exact seeds, shows the closest ratio to 1.
As shown in the runtime plots (figures \ref{fig:filter-runtime-hamming-celegans}-\ref{fig:filter-runtime-edit-celegans}), quick filtration pays off for low error rates.
Here, a quicker full-text index would be beneficial.
For $k \geq 7$, contiguous $q$-grams with $t \geq 1$ show the closest ratio to 1, nonetheless the fastest alternative is provided by filtration with 1-approximate seeds, for which only 10\,\% of the runtime goes in verifications.
Here, a judicious mix of exact and 1-approximate seeds could improve the total runtime.
The ratios for $k$-difference show analogous patterns (data not shown).

%\end{center}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Positive predictive value}

Instead of measuring filtration specificity, as introduced in section \ref{intro:filtering:spec-sens}, I measure the \emph{positive predictive value} (PPV).
As shown in table \ref{tab:filter:ppv}, I define \emph{true positives} (TP), \emph{false positives} (FP), \emph{true negatives} (TN), or \emph{false negatives} (FN) in terms of the number of verifications $V_f(t)$ triggered by the filtration phase and the number of approximate occurrences $C(t)$ of the pattern in the text.
Therefore, I define the PPV as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{|TP_f(t)|}{|TP_f(t)| + |FP_f(t)|} = \frac{C(t)}{V_f(t)}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\caption[Measurement of filtering methods efficiency]{Measurement of filtering methods efficiency. $V_f(t)$ counts the number of verifications, $C(t)$ the number of approximate occurrences, and $||t||$ the total length of the text collection. Since all considered filtering methods are full-sensitive, the number of false negatives is always 0.}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
\toprule
  & Positive & Negative\\
\midrule
True & $C(t)$ & $||t|| - C(t)$ \\
False & $V_f(t) - C(t)$ & 0		\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:filter:ppv}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:filter-ppv-hamming-celegans} shows the results for $k$-mismatches.
As expected, 2-approximate seeds have always the highest PPV, followed by 1-approximate seeds.
The PPV of contiguous $q$-grams with $t \geq 1$ oscillates around that one of exact seeds.
In particular, when $t$ approaches $1$, \eg for $k = 9$, the PPV of contiguous $q$-grams stays below that one of exact seeds.
Enforcing $t \geq 4$ boosts the PPV of contiguous $q$-grams to that one of 1-approximate seeds.
The PPVs for $k$-difference show analogous patterns (data not shown).
