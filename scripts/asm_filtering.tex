\section{Approximate seeds}

TODO.

%Filtration specificity in terms of candidate locations to verify is strongly correlated to seed length.
%Since we want to maximize the length of the shortest seed, we let the minimum seed length be $\lfloor |p|/(k+1) \rfloor$.
%If we want to improve filtration specificity by increasing seed length, we can resort to approximate seeds.
%A more involved filtering algorithm proposed in \citep{Navarro2000} reduces an approximate search into smaller approximate searches.
%We partition $p$ into $s \leq k+1$ non-overlapping seeds.
%According to the pigeonhole principle each approximate occurrence of $p$ in $t$ then contains an approximate occurrence of some seed within distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor$.
%
%Approximate seeds can be searched via backtracking on $\Ti$.
%We search $(k \bmod{s}) + 1$ seeds within distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor$ and the remaining seeds within distance $\lfloor k/s \rfloor - 1$.
%To prove full-sensitivity it suffices to see that, if none of the seeds occurs within its assigned distance, the total distance must be at least $s \cdot \lfloor k/s \rfloor + (k \bmod s) + 1 = k + 1$.
%Hence all approximate occurrences of $p$ in $t$ within distance $k$ will be found.
