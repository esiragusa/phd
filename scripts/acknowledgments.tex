The warmest thanks for this work go to my advisor, Knut Reinert.
He constantly showed his interest, motivated and guided me gently during these years.
Now I consider myself lucky and honored to have been working with him.

Special thanks go to Raffaele Giancarlo, first for having introduced me to the field of Bioinformatics, then for having recommended me to the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS), and finally for having accepted to review this thesis.
I am also grateful to my IMPRS advisors Martin Vingron and Peter N. Robinson, as well as to the IMPRS coordinator Kirsten Kelleher ---
this work has been possible thanks to the financial support of the IMPRS.

Huge thanks go to David Weese for constantly collaborating and teaching me his art of computer programming --- without his help I would not have gone far.
My gratitude goes also to Jochen Singer for jointly working on the FM-index and to Manuel Holtgrewe for working together on the evaluations of RazerS~3 and Masai.
And thanks to Jacopo Pantaleoni, Jonathan Cohen and Mark Berger for the great experience at NVIDIA!

Thanks --- for too many reasons --- to the IMPRSers: Akdes, Alessandro, Anne-Katrin, Arthur, Birte, Chris, Leon, Matt, Mike, Sabrina, Sandro, Stephan, Temesgen, Victor, Xiao, 
and to the people at the Free University: Anja, Christian, Edzard, Hannes, Julianus, Jialu, Katrin, Ren\'e.

I finally send a warm hug for their support to my parents Anna and Giovanni, my bros Alessandro and Daniele, and Vija, the sweetest thing in my life.
